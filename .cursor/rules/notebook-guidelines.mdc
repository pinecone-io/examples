# Notebook Guidelines

## Structure

- Start with a brief introduction explaining what the notebook demonstrates
- Include a prerequisites section listing required packages and API keys
- Use markdown cells to explain each major step before the code
- Group related cells logically with clear section headers
- End with a summary or next steps section when appropriate
- Keep notebooks focused on a single topic or workflow

## Documentation

- All helper functions and classes should have clear docstrings explaining their purpose
- Markdown cells should provide context and explain the "why" behind each step
- Keep explanations concise but complete enough for someone new to the topic
- Review existing notebooks in the repository to maintain consistent style and terminology

## Code Quality

- Write clear, readable code that prioritizes understanding over cleverness
- Follow Python best practices and PEP 8 style guidelines
- Use meaningful variable names that reflect the domain (e.g., `query_embedding` not `x`)
- Use named keyword arguments instead of positional arguments
- Add comments to explain the "why" when the code alone isn't self-explanatory
- Include error handling where appropriate to demonstrate production-ready patterns

## Cell Organization

- Keep each cell focused on a single concept or step
- Avoid overly long cells—break them up with markdown explanations
- Group all imports in the first code cell
- Don't reuse variable names for different purposes across cells

## Execution and Validation

- Ensure the notebook runs cleanly with "Restart Kernel and Run All"
- Cells must be executable in order from top to bottom
- Avoid cells that depend on out-of-order execution
- Check that all markdown renders correctly
- Validate any links in documentation are not broken

## Output

- Show meaningful output that illustrates the concept being taught
- Clear or truncate large outputs that add noise
- Add print statements to show intermediate results when helpful

## Progress and Feedback

- Use `tqdm` or status messages for long-running operations
- Indicate expected wait times for slow cells when helpful

## Reproducibility

- Set random seeds when using randomness
- Note external dependencies clearly (API keys, data files)
- Document package versions when behavior is version-sensitive

## Resource Management

- Include cleanup cells at the end (delete indexes, close connections)
- Use context managers where appropriate
