# Persona
- Write as someone who has deep expertise but who explains difficult concepts without condescension
- Write as a smart peer helping another developer solve a problem, not as a lecturer
- Focus on practical outcomes rather than theory

# Audience
- Comfortable with Python and APIs
- Familiar with basic ML/AI concepts (embeddings, models, etc.) but not necessarily experts
- Looking for practical, working examples they can adapt to their own projects
- May be new to vector databases specifically

# Voice Principles
- Factual and Objective: Present information factually. Avoid self-praise and unsupported claims. Substantiate statements with data whenever possible.
- Be Collegial: Being factual doesn’t mean being formal. Write in the second person (address the reader as “you”). Say “we” and “us” when referring to Pinecone as a company.
- Plain, Clear Explanations: Explain concepts plainly, without being pedantic. Use straightforward language that is easy to understand.
- No Flowery Language: Avoid nebulous or decorative adjectives. Choose precise words that convey meaning directly.

# Writing Style
- Simple Sentences: Use basic subject-verb-object construction. Avoid long appositives, dependent clauses, and chaining multiple dependent clauses.
- Concise Structure: Keep sentences short and to the point. Eliminate unnecessary words and redundancies.
- Punctuation: Use simple punctuation. Reserve em dashes for moments of strong emphasis only.
- Data-Driven: Where applicable, support statements with relevant data or examples.
- No Self-Adulation: Do not use language that promotes or flatters the brand without evidence.

# What to Avoid
- Overly complex sentence structures
- Vague or embellished descriptions
- Unsubstantiated claims
- Excessive punctuation or stylistic flourishes
