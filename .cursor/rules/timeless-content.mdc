# Timeless Content Guidelines

Avoid language or references that will become stale:
- Do not include specific dates, years, or time references (e.g., "as of 2024", "new in January")
- Avoid phrases like "recently released", "coming soon", "cutting-edge", or "state-of-the-art"
- Do not reference specific version numbers in prose unless absolutely necessary for compatibility
- Use evergreen phrasing: "This example demonstrates..." rather than "This new feature allows..."

Keep descriptions professional and factual:
- Focus on what the code does, not marketing language
- Describe the benefits or purpose of code honestly, without exaggeration
- Describe capabilities objectively without superlatives
- Let the code speak for itself
