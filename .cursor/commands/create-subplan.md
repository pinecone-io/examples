# create-subplan

Create a detailed implementation plan for a new example or documentation change.

Make sure the plan includes:

**Content considerations:**
- Clear learning objective for the reader
- Prerequisites and required setup
- Logical flow from introduction to conclusion
- Appropriate level of detail for the target audience

**Code quality:**
- Follow Python best practices and PEP 8 style
- Use meaningful variable names and clear comments
- Include error handling where appropriate
- Demonstrate production-ready patterns when possible

**Documentation quality:**
- Professional, factual tone without marketing language
- Avoid stale references (dates, versions, "new", "cutting-edge")
- Clear explanations of what each step accomplishes and why
- Links to relevant documentation where helpful

**Validation:**
- Notebook should execute from top to bottom without errors
- All markdown should render correctly
- Code outputs should be meaningful and help illustrate the concepts
- Clean up any resources (indexes, connections) at the end
