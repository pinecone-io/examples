# pr-iterate

Check the PR to see if there are any CI failures, review comments, or inline comments.

For each error or piece of feedback:
- Verify the problem exists. If the problem does not exist, reply on github with relevant context.
- Plan and implement a fix for the problem
- Make a commit that describes the change
- Push the commit
- If the feedback is an inline comment, reply saying the feedback was addressed. Then mark the conversation as resolved.
- If the feedback was from an overall review comment, reply saying the feedback was addressed.

Next, check the PR to see if there are any inline comments that are not part of a formal review. Follow the same procedure for confirming, fixing, and pushing changes. Mark the conversation as resolved when the fix has been pushed.
