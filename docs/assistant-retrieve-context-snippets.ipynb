        "# Pinecone Assistant - Context snippets\n",
        "\n",
        "The [Pinecone Assistant](https://docs.pinecone.io/guides/assistant/overview) `context_assistant` operation lets you directly retrieve relevant information snippets for your queries. Using the same set of files uploaded to Assistant, you can now alternate between `.chat()` and `.context()` requests and use Pinecone Assistant in different ways across different layers of your application stack.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Motivation\n",
        "\n",
        "The `context_assistant` operation is designed to enable two capabilities: 1) enable the use of Assistant with different LLMs (e.g., Llama 3.1) and 2) directly access retrieved relevant context information without a model reasoning step. The operation provides all the benefits of Assistant-- including parsing, chunking, and indexing on upload, as well as query planning, searching, and result aggregation on query—- while bypassing LLM reasoning and the associated transformation of the results."

The expected timing of the payment of the obligations discussed below is estimated based on information available to us as of December 31,\\r\\n2015. Timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the time of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreed-upon amounts for\\r\\nsome obligations. The following table summarizes our contractual obligations at December 31, 2015:\\r\\nPayments due by Period\\r\\nContractual obligations (in thousands): Total\\r\\nLess than\\r\\n1 year 1-3 years 3-5 years\\r\\nMore than\\r\\n5 years\\r\\nStreaming content obligations (1) $ 10,902,231 $ 4,703,172 $ 5,249,147 $ 891,864 $ 58,048\\r\\nDebt (2) 3,425,813 135,375 270,750 270,750 2,748,938\\r\\nLease obligations (3) 529,744 42,545 112,826 104,996 269,377\\r\\nOther purchase obligations (4) 322,793 217,004 105,275 170 344\\r\\nTotal $ 15,180,581 $ 5,098,096 $ 5,737,998 $ 1,267,780 $ 3,076,707\\r\\n(1) As of December 31, 2015, streaming content obligations were comprised of $2.8 billion included in \"Current content liabilities\" and $2.0 billion of \"Non\\x02current content liabilities\" on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and $6.1 billion of obligations that are not reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as\\r\\nthey do not yet meet the criteria for asset recognition.\\r\\nStreaming content obligations increased $1.4 billion from $9.5 billion as of December 31, 2014 to $10.9 billion as of December 31, 2015 primarily due to\\r\\nmulti-year commitments primarily associated with the continued expansion of our exclusive and original programing.\\r\\nStreaming content obligations include amounts related to the acquisition, licensing and production of streaming content. An obligation for the production of\\r\\ncontent includes non-cancelable commitments under creative talent and employment agreements. An obligation for the acquisition and licensing of content\\r\\nis incurred at the time we enter into an agreement\\r\\n26Table of Contents\\r\\nto obtain future titles. Once a title becomes available, a content liability is recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Certain agreements include the\\r\\nobligation to license rights for unknown future titles, the ultimate quantity and / or fees for which are not yet determinable as of the reporting date.\\r\\nTraditional film output deals, like the U.S. output deal with Disney, or certain TV series license agreements where the number of seasons to be aired is\\r\\nunknown, are examples of these types of agreements. The contractual obligations table above does not include any estimated obligation for the unknown\\r\\nfuture titles, payment for which could range from less than one year to more than five years. However, these unknown obligations are expected to be\\r\\nsignificant and we believe could include approximately $3 billion to $5 billion over the next three years, with the payments for the vast majority of such\\r\\namounts expected to occur after the next twelve months. The foregoing range is based on considerable management judgments and the actual amounts may\\r\\ndiffer. Once we know the title that we will receive and the license fees, we include the amount in the contractual obligations table above.\\r\\n(2) Long-term debt obligations include our Notes consisting of principal and interest payments.

The contribution profit generated by our domestic DVD business\\r\\nwill help provide capital resources to fund our growth internationally. To the extent that the rate of decline in our DVD-by-mail business is greater than we\\r\\nanticipate, our business could be adversely affected. We do not anticipate increasing resources to our DVD operations and the technology used in its operations\\r\\nwill not be meaningfully improved. To the extent that we experience service interruptions or other degradations in our DVD-by-mail service, members' satisfaction\\r\\ncould be negatively impacted and we could experience an increase in DVD-by-mail member cancellations, which could adversely impact our business.\\r\\nChanges in U.S. Postal rates or operations could adversely impact our operating results and member satisfaction.\\r\\nWe rely exclusively on the U.S. Postal Service to deliver DVDs from our shipping centers and to return DVDs to us from our members.

Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and\\r\\nprocedures as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K were effective in providing reasonable assurance that information required to\\r\\nbe disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported\\r\\nwithin the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to\\r\\nour management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.\\r\\nOur management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our\\r\\ninternal controls will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute,\\r\\nassurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the\\r\\nbenefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide\\r\\nabsolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within Netflix have been detected.\\r\\n(b) Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\\r\\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the\\r\\nSecurities Exchange Act of 1934 as amended (the Exchange Act)). Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of\\r\\nDecember 31, 2015 . In making this assessment, our management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway\\r\\nCommission (“COSO”) in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013 framework). Based on our assessment under the framework in Internal Control—\\r\\nIntegrated Framework (2013 framework), our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2015 . The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015 has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered\\r\\npublic accounting firm, as stated in their report that is included herein.\\r\\n(c) Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\\r\\nThere was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2015 that has materially affected,\\r\\nor is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\\r\\n31Table of Contents\\r\\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\\r\\nThe Board of Directors and Stockholders of Netflix, Inc.\\r\\nWe have audited Netflix, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated\\r\\nFramework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria).

Our original programming increasingly includes content that we produce.\\r\\nBUSINESS SEGMENTS\\r\\nThe Company has three reportable segments: Domestic streaming, International streaming and Domestic DVD. The Domestic streaming segment derives\\r\\nrevenues from monthly membership fees for services consisting solely of streaming content to our members in the United States. The International streaming\\r\\nsegment derives revenues from monthly membership fees for services consisting solely of streaming content to our members outside the United States. The\\r\\nDomestic DVD segment derives revenues from monthly membership fees for services consisting solely of DVD-by-mail. For additional information regarding our\\r\\nsegments, including information about our financial results by geography, see Note 12 of Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data . 1Table of Contents\\r\\nCOMPETITION\\r\\nThe market for entertainment video is intensely competitive and subject to rapid change. We compete against other entertainment video providers, such as\\r\\nmultichannel video programming distributors (\"MVPDs\"), Internet-based movie and TV content providers (including those that provide pirated content), video\\r\\ngaming providers and DVD rental outlets and more broadly against other sources of entertainment that our members could choose in their moments of free time.\\r\\nWe also compete against entertainment video providers in obtaining content that our members love, both for licensed streaming content and for original content\\r\\nprojects.\\r\\nWhile consumers may maintain simultaneous relationships with multiple entertainment sources, we strive for consumers to choose us in their moments of\\r\\nfree time. We have often referred to this choice as our objective of \"winning moments of truth.\" In attempting to win these moments of truth with our members, we\\r\\nare continually improving our service, including both our technology and our content, which is increasingly exclusive and curated, and includes our own original\\r\\nprogramming.\\r\\nSEASONALITY\\r\\nOur membership growth exhibits a seasonal pattern that reflects variations when consumers buy Internet-connected screens and when they tend to increase\\r\\ntheir viewing. Historically, the first and fourth quarters (October through March)represent our greatest membership growth across our Domestic and International\\r\\nstreaming segments and the fewest membership losses in our Domestic DVD segment. Our membership growth may be impacted by the release of certain high\\r\\nprofile original content. Internationally, we expect each market to demonstrate more predictable seasonal patterns as our service offering in each market becomes\\r\\nmore established and we have a longer history to assess such patterns.\\r\\nINTELLECTUAL PROPERTY\\r\\nWe regard our trademarks, service marks, copyrights, patents, domain names, trade dress, trade secrets, proprietary technologies and similar intellectual\\r\\nproperty as important to our success. We use a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws and confidentiality agreements to protect our\\r\\nproprietary intellectual property. Our ability to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights is subject to certain risks and from time to time we encounter\\r\\ndisputes over rights and obligations concerning intellectual property. We cannot provide assurance that we will prevail in any intellectual property disputes.\\r\\nEMPLOYEES\\r\\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had approximately 3,700 total employees. Of these employees, approximately 3,500 were full-time, including approximately\\r\\n400 categorized as temporary.\\r\\nOTHER INFORMATION\\r\\nWe were incorporated in Delaware in August 1997 and completed our initial public offering in May 2002. Our principal executive offices are located at 100\\r\\nWinchester Circle, Los Gatos, California 95032, and our telephone number is (408) 540-3700.\\r\\nWe maintain a Web site at www.netflix.com.

In that case, the trading price of our\\r\\ncommon stock could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\\r\\nRisks Related to Our Business\\r\\nIf our efforts to attract and retain members are not successful, our business will be adversely affected.\\r\\nWe have experienced significant membership growth over the past several years. Our ability to continue to attract members will depend in part on our ability\\r\\nto consistently provide our members with compelling content choices, as well as a quality experience for selecting and viewing TV shows and movies.\\r\\nFurthermore, the relative service levels, content offerings, pricing and related features of competitors to our service may adversely impact our ability to attract and\\r\\nretain memberships.

Business\\r\\nABOUT US\\r\\nNetflix, Inc. (“Netflix”, “the Company”, “we”, or “us”) is the world’s leading Internet television network with over 75 million streaming members in over\\r\\n190 countries enjoying more than 125 million hours of TV shows and movies per day, including original series, documentaries and feature films. Our members can\\r\\nwatch as much as they want, anytime, anywhere, on nearly any Internet-connected screen. Members can play, pause and resume watching, all without commercials\\r\\nor commitments. Additionally, in the United States (\"U.S.\"), our members can receive DVDs delivered quickly to their homes.\\r\\nWe are a pioneer in the Internet delivery of TV shows and movies, launching our streaming service in 2007. Since this launch, we have developed an\\r\\necosystem for Internet-connected screens and have added increasing amounts of content that enable consumers to enjoy TV shows and movies directly on their\\r\\nInternet-connected screens. As a result of these efforts, we have experienced growing consumer acceptance of, and interest in, the delivery of TV shows and\\r\\nmovies directly over the Internet.\\r\\nOur core strategy is to grow our streaming membership business globally within the parameters of our consolidated net income and operating segment\\r\\ncontribution profit (loss) targets. We are continuously improving our members\\' experience by expanding our streaming content with a focus on a programming mix\\r\\nof content that delights our members. In addition, we are perpetually enhancing our user interface and extending our streaming service to more Internet-connected\\r\\nscreens. We continue to grow our streaming service both domestically and internationally. We began our international expansion with Canada in 2010 and have since\\r\\nlaunched our service globally, with the exception of The People\\'s Republic of China and territories where U.S. companies are not allowed to operate. We have also\\r\\nexpanded our streaming content offering to include more exclusive and original programming, including several Emmy, Golden Globe and Academy Award\\r\\nnominated original series and documentaries.

In July 2011, we separated the combined plans, making it necessary for members who wish to receive both DVDs-by-mail and streaming\\r\\ncontent to have two separate membership plans. Prior to these changes to our pricing and plan structure in 2011, we did not separately track streaming\\r\\nmemberships.\\r\\n(1) A membership (also referred to as a subscription or a member) is defined as the right to receive the Netflix service following sign-up and a method of\\r\\npayment being provided. Memberships are assigned to territories based on the geographic location used at time of sign-up as determined by our internal\\r\\nsystems, which utilize industry standard geo-location technology. We offer free-trial memberships to new and certain rejoining members. Total members\\r\\ninclude those who are on a free-trial as long as a method of payment has been provided. A membership is canceled and ceases to be reflected in the above\\r\\nmetrics as of the effective cancellation date. Voluntary cancellations become effective at the end of the prepaid membership period, while involuntary\\r\\ncancellation of the service, as a result of a failed method of payment, becomes effective immediately except in limited circumstances where a short grace\\r\\nperiod is offered to ensure the streaming service is not interrupted for members who are impacted by payment processing delays by our banks or integrated\\r\\npayment partners. The number of members in a grace period at any given point is not material.\\r\\n16Table of Contents\\r\\nItem 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\\r\\nOverview and Results of Operations\\r\\nThe following represents our consolidated performance highlights:\\r\\nAs of/ Year Ended December 31, Change\\r\\n2015 2014 2013 2015 vs. 2014 2014 vs. 2013\\r\\n(in thousands, except revenue per membership and percentages)\\r\\nGlobal streaming memberships 74,762 57,391 44,350 30 % 29%\\r\\nGlobal streaming average monthly revenue per paying membership $ 8.15 $ 8.20 $ 8.03 (1)% 2%\\r\\nRevenues $ 6,779,511 $ 5,504,656 $ 4,374,562 23 % 26%\\r\\nOperating income $ 305,826 $ 402,648 $ 228,347 (24)% 76%\\r\\nNet income $ 122,641 $ 266,799 $ 112,403 (54)% 137%\\r\\nConsolidated revenues for 2015 and 2014 increased as compared to prior years due to growth in global streaming average paying memberships, the majority\\r\\nof which was growth in our international memberships reflecting our expansion and focus on Netflix as a global Internet TV network. For the year ended\\r\\nDecember 31, 2015, the impact from membership growth was slightly offset by a decrease in average monthly revenue per paying streaming membership resulting\\r\\nfrom unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations impacting our International streaming segment. This was partially offset by increases resulting from price changes\\r\\nand plan mix. The decrease in operating income for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 is due primarily to\\r\\nincreased marketing and headcount costs to support our international expansion in addition to increased content expenses as we continue to acquire, license and\\r\\nproduce content, including more Netflix originals. Net income is further impacted by the increase in interest expense associated with our debt issuance in the first\\r\\nquarter of 2015 as well as to an increase in losses on foreign currency denominated transactions.\\r\\nWe offer three types of streaming membership plans. In the U.S. our basic plan is priced at $7.99 per month and includes access to standard definition quality\\r\\nstreaming on a single screen at a time. Our most popular streaming plan is priced at $9.99 per month and includes access to high definition quality streaming on\\r\\ntwo screens concurrently. Our premium plan is priced at $11.99 per month and includes access to high definition and ultra-high definition quality content on four\\r\\nscreens concurrently. Internationally, the membership plans are structured similarly to the U.S. and range in price from the U.S. dollar equivalent of approximately\\r\\n$5.00 to $18.00 per month.\\r\\nWe expect that from time to time the prices of our membership plans in each country may change. For instance, in the second half of 2015, we increased the\\r\\nprice of our two-screen high definition plan in the U.S. and several European countries. In May 2014, in the U.S., we increased the price of our high definition plan\\r\\nfrom $7.99 per month to $8.99 per month with existing memberships grandfathered for a two year period. In October 2015, in the U.S., we increased the price of\\r\\nthis same high definition plan from $8.99 per month to $9.99 per month with existing memberships grandfathered for a one year period. In 2016, the grandfathered\\r\\npricing period will expire for a substantial number of U.S. memberships and the members will have the option of electing the basic streaming plan at $7.99 or\\r\\ncontinuing on the high definition plan at the higher price of $9.99.\\r\\nThe following represents the key elements to our segment results of operations: • We define contribution profit (loss) as revenues less cost of revenues and marketing expenses incurred by the segment. We believe this is an important\\r\\nmeasure of our operating segment performance as it represents each segment\\'s performance before global corporate costs. • For the Domestic and International streaming segments, content expenses, which include the amortization of the streaming content assets and other\\r\\nexpenses associated with the licensing and acquisition of streaming content, represent the vast majority of cost of revenues. Streaming content rights were\\r\\ngenerally obtained for our current geographic regions. As we expanded internationally, we obtained additional rights for the new geographies. With our\\r\\nglobal expansion, we now aspire to obtain global rights for our new content.

However, an estimate\\r\\nof the range of reasonably possible adjustments cannot be made.\\r\\n11. Employee Benefit Plan\\r\\nThe Company maintains a 401(k) savings plan covering substantially all of its employees. Eligible employees may contribute up to 60% of their annual\\r\\nsalary through payroll deductions, but not more than the statutory limits set by the Internal Revenue Service. The Company matches employee contributions at the\\r\\ndiscretion of the Board. During 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , the Company’s matching contributions totaled $11.2 million , $8.3 million and $6.5 million , respectively.\\r\\n12. Segment Information\\r\\nThe Company has three reportable segments: Domestic streaming, International streaming and Domestic DVD. Segment information is presented along the\\r\\nsame lines that the Company’s chief operating decision maker (\"CODM\") reviews the operating results in assessing performance and allocating resources. The\\r\\nCompany’s CODM reviews revenue and contribution profit (loss) for each of the reportable segments. Contribution profit (loss) is defined as revenues less cost of\\r\\nrevenues and marketing expenses incurred by the segment. The Company has aggregated the results of the International operating segments into one reportable\\r\\nsegment because these operating segments share similar long-term economic and other qualitative characteristics.\\r\\nThe Domestic streaming segment derives revenues from monthly membership fees for services consisting solely of streaming content to the members in the\\r\\nUnited States. The International streaming segment derives revenues from monthly membership fees for services consisting solely of streaming content to\\r\\nmembers outside of the United States. The Domestic DVD segment derives revenues from monthly membership fees for services consisting solely of DVD-by\\x02mail. Revenues and the related payment card fees are attributed to the operating segment based on the nature of the underlying membership (streaming or DVD)\\r\\nand the geographic region from which the membership originates. There are no internal revenue transactions between the Company’s segments.\\r\\nThe majority of cost of revenues relate to content expenses directly incurred by the segment. However, in connection with global expansion, content\\r\\nacquired, licensed, and produced increasingly includes global rights.

See Note 5 of Item\\r\\n8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for additional information.\\r\\nOur primary uses of cash include the acquisition, licensing and production of content, streaming delivery, marketing programs and payroll. Investments in\\r\\noriginal content and in particular content that we produce and own, require more cash upfront relative to licensed content. We expect to significantly increase our\\r\\ninvestments in global streaming content, particularly in original content, which could impact our liquidity and result in future negative free cash flows.\\r\\nAlthough we currently anticipate that cash flows from operations, together with our available funds, will continue to be sufficient to meet our cash needs for\\r\\nat least the next twelve months, to fund our continued content investments, we are likely to raise additional capital in future periods. Our ability to obtain this, or\\r\\nany additional financing that we may choose to, or need to, obtain to finance our international expansion, or investment in original content or otherwise, will\\r\\ndepend on, among other things, our development efforts, business plans, operating performance and the condition of the capital markets at the time we seek\\r\\nfinancing. We may not be able to obtain such financing on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or debt\\r\\nsecurities, those securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to the rights of our common stock, and our stockholders may experience dilution.\\r\\n24Table of Contents\\r\\nAs of December 31, 2015, $200.3 million of cash and cash equivalents were held by our foreign subsidiaries. If these funds are needed for our operations in\\r\\nthe U.S., we would be required to accrue and pay U.S. income taxes and foreign withholding taxes on the amount associated with undistributed earnings for certain\\r\\nforeign subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2015, the amount associated with undistributed earnings for certain foreign subsidiaries for which we could be required to\\r\\naccrue and pay taxes is $65.3 million. See Note 10 of Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for additional information.\\r\\nFree Cash Flow\\r\\nWe define free cash flow as cash (used in) provided by operating and investing activities excluding the non-operational cash flows from purchases, maturities\\r\\nand sales of short-term investments. We believe free cash flow is an important liquidity metric because it measures, during a given period, the amount of cash\\r\\ngenerated that is available to repay debt obligations, make investments and for certain other activities. Free cash flow is considered a non-GAAP financial measure\\r\\nand should not be considered in isolation of, or as a substitute for, net income, operating income, cash flow (used in) provided by operating activities, or any other\\r\\nmeasure of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with GAAP.\\r\\nIn assessing liquidity in relation to our results of operations, we compare free cash flow to net income, noting that the three major recurring differences are\\r\\nexcess content payments over expense, non-cash stock-based compensation expense and other working capital differences. The excess content payments over\\r\\nexpense is variable based on the payment terms of our content agreements and is expected to increase as we enter into more agreements with upfront cash\\r\\npayments, such as licensing and production of original content. In 2015, the ratio of content payments over content expense was between 1.3 and 1.4. Working\\r\\ncapital differences include deferred revenue, taxes and semi-annual interest payments on our outstanding debt. Our receivables from members generally settle\\r\\nquickly and deferred revenue is a source of cash flow.\\r\\nYear Ended December 31,\\r\\n2015 2014 2013\\r\\n(in thousands)\\r\\nNet cash (used in) provided by operating activities $ (749,439) $ 16,483 $ 97,831\\r\\nNet cash used in investing activities (179,192) (42,866) (255,968)\\r\\nNet cash provided by financing activities 1,640,277 541,712 476,264\\r\\nNon-GAAP free cash flow reconciliation:\\r\\nNet cash (used in) provided by operating activities (749,439) 16,483 97,831\\r\\nAcquisition of DVD content assets (77,958) (74,790) (65,927)\\r\\nPurchases of property and equipment (91,248) (69,726) (54,143)\\r\\nOther assets (1,912) 1,334 5,939\\r\\nNon-GAAP free cash flow $ (920,557) $ (126,699) $ (16,300)\\r\\nYear ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014\\r\\nCash provided by operating activities decreased $765.9 million resulting in net cash used in operating activities of $749.4 million for the year ended\\r\\nDecember 31, 2015.

The hierarchy level assigned to each security in the Company’s available-for-sale portfolio and cash equivalents is based on its assessment of the\\r\\ntransparency and reliability of the inputs used in the valuation of such instrument at the measurement date. The fair value of available-for-sale securities and cash\\r\\nequivalents included in the Level 1 category is based on quoted prices that are readily and regularly available in an active market.

Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\\r\\nDescription of Business\\r\\nNetflix, Inc. (the “Company”) was incorporated on August 29, 1997 and began operations on April 14, 1998. The Company is the world’s leading Internet\\r\\ntelevision network with over 75 million streaming members in over 190 countries enjoying more than 125 million hours of hours of TV shows and movies per day,\\r\\nincluding original series, documentaries and feature films. Members can watch as much as they want, anytime, anywhere, on nearly any Internet-connected screen.\\r\\nMembers can play, pause and resume watching, all without commercials or commitments. Additionally, in the United States (\"U.S.\"), members can receive DVDs.\\r\\nThe Company has three reportable segments, Domestic streaming, International streaming and Domestic DVD. A majority of the Company’s revenues are\\r\\ngenerated in the United States, and substantially all of the Company’s long-lived tangible assets are held in the United States. The Company’s revenues are derived\\r\\nfrom monthly membership fees.\\r\\nBasis of Presentation\\r\\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. Intercompany balances and transactions have\\r\\nbeen eliminated.\\r\\nUse of Estimates\\r\\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires\\r\\nmanagement to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of\\r\\nthe financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Significant items subject to such estimates and\\r\\nassumptions include the amortization policy for the streaming content assets; the recognition and measurement of income tax assets and liabilities; and the\\r\\nvaluation of stock-based compensation. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that the Company believes to\\r\\nbe reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\\r\\nStock Split\\r\\nOn July 14, 2015, the Company completed a seven -for-one stock split in the form of a stock dividend. References made to outstanding shares or per share\\r\\namounts in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and applicable disclosures have been retroactively adjusted to reflect this seven -for-one stock\\r\\nsplit. The number of authorized shares as reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets was not affected by the stock split and accordingly has not been adjusted.\\r\\nSee Note 8 for additional information.\\r\\nAccounting Guidance Adopted in 2015\\r\\nIn April 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") 2015-05, Customer\\'s Accounting for Fees\\r\\nPaid in a Cloud Computing Arrangement, which provides guidance to customers about whether a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license. If a\\r\\ncloud computing arrangement includes a software license, the customer should account for the software license element of the arrangement consistent with the\\r\\nacquisition of other software licenses. If the arrangement does not include a software license, the customer should account for a cloud computing arrangement as a\\r\\nservice contract. The Company elected to early adopt the ASU in the third quarter of 2015 and has applied the guidance prospectively to all arrangements. The\\r\\nimpact of the adoption of the ASU was not material to the Company\\'s consolidated financial statements.\\r\\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03, Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs which changes the presentation of debt issuance costs in\\r\\nfinancial statements. ASU 2015-03 requires an entity to present such costs in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the related debt liability rather than as an\\r\\nasset. Amortization of the costs will continue to be reported as interest expense. The Company elected to early adopt ASU 2015-03 as of December 31, 2015, and\\r\\nretrospectively reclassifed $14.2 million of debt issuance costs associated with the Company\\'s long-term debt as of December 31, 2014 from other non-current\\r\\nassets to long-term debt.\\r\\nIn November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17, Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes to simplify the presentation of deferred income taxes.\\r\\nThe amendments in this update require that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position. The\\r\\nCompany has elected to early adopt ASU 2015-17 as\\r\\n43Table of Contents\\r\\nof December 31, 2015 and retrospectively applied ASU 2015-17 to all periods presented. As of December 31, 2014 the Company reclassified $13.4 million of\\r\\ndeferred tax assets from \"Other current assets\" to \"Other non-current assets\" on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\\r\\nAccounting Guidance Not Yet Adopted\\r\\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) ', score=0.3025976, reference=PdfReference(type='pdf', pages=[44, 45, 46], file=FileModel(name='netflix-10k.pdf', id='4fecb1e0-3874-4706-8d7e-2962574401a9', metadata={'document_type': '10k', 'published': '2016-01-28'}, created_on='2025-07-03T20:36:49.488104873Z', updated_on='2025-07-03T20:37:01.426460790Z', status='Available', percent_done=1.0, signed_url='https://storage.googleapis.com/knowledge-prod-files/0f8f519e-6a02-42a7-a901-fe1c0dd33e52%2Fd00cf68c-0be6-40b4-b0f1-394afa7c553c%2F4fecb1e0-3874-4706-8d7e-2962574401a9.pdf?X-Goog-Algorithm=GOOG4-RSA-SHA256&X-Goog-Credential=ke-prod-1%40pc-knowledge-prod.iam.gserviceaccount.com%2F20250703%2Fauto%2Fstorage%2Fgoog4_request&X-Goog-Date=20250703T211631Z&X-Goog-Expires=3600&X-Goog-SignedHeaders=host&response-content-disposition=inline&response-content-type=application%2Fpdf&X-Goog-Signature=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', error_message=None, size=578489)))]\n"
