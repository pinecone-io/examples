    "# Cascading Retrieval (aka hybrid search)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you'll learn how to use Pinecone to combine the benefits of semantic and lexical search using a technique called cascading retrieval or [hybrid search with two indexes](https://docs.pinecone.io/guides/search/hybrid-search).\n",
    "\n",
    "Semantic search and lexical search are powerful information retrieval techniques, but each has notable limitations. For example, semantic search can miss results based on exact keyword matches, especially in scenarios involving domain-specific terminology. While lexical search can miss results based on relationships, such as synonyms and paraphrases.\n",
    "\n",
    "When dense and sparse retrieval are combined along with reranking — an approach we call cascading retrieval — you get up to 48% better performance than either sparse or dense alone.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can read more about how cascading retrieval works [here](https://www.pinecone.io/blog/cascading-retrieval/).\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example below, we'll search over financial headlines."
