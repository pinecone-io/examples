Mixtral has the same architecture as Mistral 7B, with the difference that each layer is composed of 8 feedforward blocks (i.e. experts). For every token, at each layer, a router network selects two experts to process the current state and combine their outputs. Even though each token only sees two experts, the selected experts can be different at each timestep. As a result, each token has access to 47B parameters, but only uses 13B active parameters during inference. Mixtral was trained with a context size of 32k tokens and it outperforms or matches Llama 2 70B and GPT-3.5 across all evaluated benchmarks. In particular, Mixtral vastly outperforms Llama 2 70B on mathematics, code generation, and multilingual benchmarks. We also provide a model fine- tuned to follow instructions, Mixtral 8x7B â\\x80\\x93 Instruct, that surpasses GPT-3.5 Turbo, Claude-2.1, Gemini Pro, and Llama 2 70B â\\x80\\x93 chat model on human bench- marks. Both the base and instruct models are released under the Apache 2.0 license.\\nCode: https://github.com/mistralai/mistral-src Webpage: https://mistral.ai/news/mixtral-of-experts/\\n# Introduction\\nIn this paper, we present Mixtral 8x7B, a sparse mixture of experts model (SMoE) with open weights, licensed under Apache 2.0. Mixtral outperforms Llama 2 70B and GPT-3.5 on most benchmarks. As it only uses a subset of its parameters for every token, Mixtral allows faster inference speed at low batch-sizes, and higher throughput at large batch-sizes.\\nMixtral is a sparse mixture-of-experts network. It is a decoder-only model where the feedforward block picks from a set of 8 distinct groups of parameters. At every layer, for every token, a router network chooses two of these groups (the â\\x80\\x9cexpertsâ\\x80\\x9d) to process the token and combine their output additively. This technique increases the number of parameters of a model while controlling cost and latency, as the model only uses a fraction of the total set of parameters per token.\\nMixtral is pretrained with multilingual data using a context size of 32k tokens. It either matches or exceeds the performance of Llama 2 70B and GPT-3.5, over several benchmarks. In particular,\\nMixture of Experts Layer i gating inputs af outputs router expert\\nFigure 1: Mixture of Experts Layer. Each input vector is assigned to 2 of the 8 experts by a router. The layerâ\\x80\\x99s output is the weighted sum of the outputs of the two selected experts. In Mixtral, an expert is a standard feedforward block as in a vanilla transformer architecture.\\nMixtral demonstrates superior capabilities in mathematics, code generation, and tasks that require multilingual understanding, significantly outperforming Llama 2 70B in these domains. Experiments show that Mixtral is able to successfully retrieve information from its context window of 32k tokens, regardless of the sequence length and the location of the information in the sequence.\\nWe also present Mixtral 8x7B â\\x80\\x93 Instruct, a chat model fine-tuned to follow instructions using supervised fine-tuning and Direct Preference Optimization [25]. Its performance notably surpasses that of GPT-3.5 Turbo, Claude-2.1, Gemini Pro, and Llama 2 70B â\\x80\\x93 chat model on human evaluation benchmarks. Mixtral â\\x80\\x93 Instruct also demonstrates reduced biases, and a more balanced sentiment profile in benchmarks such as BBQ, and BOLD. We release both Mixtral 8x7B and Mixtral 8x7B â\\x80\\x93 Instruct under the Apache 2.0 license1, free for academic and commercial usage, ensuring broad accessibility and potential for diverse applications. To enable the community to run Mixtral with a fully open-source stack, we submitted changes to the vLLM project, which integrates Megablocks CUDA kernels for efficient inference. Skypilot also allows the deployment of vLLM endpoints on any instance in the cloud.\\n# 2 Architectural details\\nMixtral is based on a transformer architecture [31] and uses the same modifications as described in [18], with the notable exceptions that Mix- tral supports a fully dense context length of 32k tokens, and the feed- forward blocks are replaced by Mixture-of-Expert layers (Section 2.1). The model architecture parameters are summarized in Table 1. Parameter Value\\ndim n_layers head_dim hidden_dim n_heads n_kv_heads context_len vocab_size num_experts top_k_experts\\n# 2.1 Sparse Mixture of Experts\\nWe present a brief overview of the Mixture of Experts layer (Figure 1). For a more in-depth overview, see [12]. The output of the MoE module for a given input x is determined by the weighted sum of the outputs of the expert networks, where the weights are given by the gating networkâ\\x80\\x99s output. i.e. given n expert networks {E0, Ei, ..., Enâ\\x88\\x921}, the output of the expert layer is given by: Table 1: Model architecture.\\n# j nâ\\x80\\x94\\nG(x)i Â· Ei(x). i=0\\nHere, G(x)i denotes the n-dimensional output of the gating network for the i-th expert, and Ei(x) is the output of the i-th expert network. If the gating vector is sparse, we can avoid computing the outputs of experts whose gates are zero. There are multiple alternative ways of implementing G(x) [6, 15, 35], but a simple and performant one is implemented by taking the softmax over the Top-K logits of a linear layer [28]. We use\\nG(x) := Softmax(TopK(x Â· Wg)),\\nwhere (TopK(â\\x84\\x93))i := â\\x84\\x93i if â\\x84\\x93i is among the top-K coordinates of logits â\\x84\\x93 â\\x88\\x88 Rn and (TopK(â\\x84\\x93))i := â\\x88\\x92â\\x88\\x9e otherwise. The value of K â\\x80\\x93 the number of experts used per token â\\x80\\x93 is a hyper-parameter that modu- lates the amount of compute used to process each token. If one increases n while keeping K fixed, one\\n# 1https://mistral.ai/news/mixtral-of-experts/\\n2\\n4096 32 128 14336 32 8 32768 32000 8 2\\ncan increase the modelâ\\x80\\x99s parameter count while keeping its computational cost effectively constant. This motivates a distinction between the modelâ\\x80\\x99s total parameter count (commonly referenced as the sparse parameter count), which grows with n, and the number of parameters used for processing an individual token (called the active parameter count), which grows with K up to n.\\nMoE layers can be run efficiently on single GPUs with high performance specialized kernels. For example, Megablocks [13] casts the feed-forward network (FFN) operations of the MoE layer as large sparse matrix multiplications, significantly enhancing the execution speed and naturally handling cases where different experts get a variable number of tokens assigned to them. Moreover, the MoE layer can be distributed to multiple GPUs through standard Model Parallelism techniques, and through a particular kind of partitioning strategy called Expert Parallelism (EP) [28]. During the MoE layerâ\\x80\\x99s execution, tokens meant to be processed by a specific expert are routed to the corresponding GPU for processing, and the expertâ\\x80\\x99s output is returned to the original token location. Note that EP introduces challenges in load balancing, as it is essential to distribute the workload evenly across the GPUs to prevent overloading individual GPUs or hitting computational bottlenecks.\\nIn a Transformer model, the MoE layer is applied independently per token and replaces the feed-forward (FFN) sub-block of the transformer block. For Mixtral we use the same SwiGLU architecture as the expert function Ei(x) and set K = 2. This means each token is routed to two SwiGLU sub-blocks with different sets of weights. Taking this all together, the output y for an input token x is computed as:\\nn-1 y= Ss Softmax(Top2(a - W,)); - SwiGLU;(a). i=0\\nThis formulation is similar to the GShard architecture [21], with the exceptions that we replace all FFN sub-blocks by MoE layers while GShard replaces every other block, and that GShard uses a more elaborate gating strategy for the second expert assigned to each token.\\n# 3 Results\\nWe compare Mixtral to Llama, and re-run all benchmarks with our own evaluation pipeline for fair comparison.

Mixtral largely outperforms Llama 2 70B on all benchmarks, except on reading comprehension benchmarks while using 5x lower active parameters. It is also vastly superior to Llama 2 70B on code and math.\\nDetailed results for Mixtral, Mistral 7B and Llama 2 7B/13B/70B and Llama 1 34B2 are reported in Table 2. Figure 2 compares the performance of Mixtral with the Llama models in different categories. Mixtral surpasses Llama 2 70B across most metrics. In particular, Mixtral displays a superior performance in code and mathematics benchmarks.\\nSize and Efficiency. We compare our performance to the Llama 2 family, aiming to understand Mixtral modelsâ\\x80\\x99 efficiency in the cost-performance spectrum (see Figure 3). As a sparse Mixture- of-Experts model, Mixtral only uses 13B active parameters for each token. With 5x lower active parameters, Mixtral is able to outperform Llama 2 70B across most categories.\\nNote that this analysis focuses on the active parameter count (see Section 2.1), which is directly proportional to the inference compute cost, but does not consider the memory costs and hardware utilization. The memory costs for serving Mixtral are proportional to its sparse parameter count, 47B, which is still smaller than Llama 2 70B. As for device utilization, we note that the SMoEs layer introduces additional overhead due to the routing mechanism and due to the increased memory loads when running more than one expert per device. They are more suitable for batched workloads where one can reach a good degree of arithmetic intensity.\\nComparison with Llama 2 70B and GPT-3.5. In Table 3, we report the performance of Mixtral 8x7B compared to Llama 2 70B and GPT-3.5. We observe that Mixtral performs similarly or above the two other models. On MMLU, Mixtral obtains a better performance, despite its significantly smaller capacity (47B tokens compared to 70B). For MT Bench, we report the performance of the latest GPT-3.5-Turbo model available, gpt-3.5-turbo-1106.\\n2Since Llama 2 34B was not open-sourced, we report results for Llama 1 34B.\\n4\\nLLaMA 2 70B GPT-3.5 MMLU (MCQ in 57 subjects) 69.9% 70.0% 70.6% HellaSwag (10-shot) 87.1% 85.5% 86.7% ARC Challenge (25-shot) 85.1% 85.2% 85.8% WinoGrande (5-shot) 83.2% 81.6% 81.2% MBPP (pass@1) 49.8% 52.2% 60.7% GSM-8K (5-shot) 53.6% 57.1% 58.4% MT Bench (for Instruct Models) 6.86 8.32 8.30\\n# Mixtral 8x7B\\nTable 3: Comparison of Mixtral with Llama 2 70B and GPT-3.5.

On some benchmarks, there are some differences between our evaluation protocol and the one reported in the Llama 2 paper: 1) on MBPP, we use the hand-verified subset 2) on TriviaQA, we do not provide Wikipedia contexts.\\n# 3.1 Multilingual benchmarks\\nCompared to Mistral 7B, we significantly upsample the proportion of multilingual data during pretraining. The extra capacity allows Mixtral to perform well on multilingual benchmarks while maintaining a high accuracy in English.

Results in Figure 4 (Left) show that Mixtral achieves a 100% retrieval accuracy regardless of the context length or the position of passkey in the sequence. Figure 4 (Right) shows that the perplexity of Mixtral on a subset of the proof-pile dataset [2] decreases monotonically as the size of the context increases.\\nPasskey Performance ry 0.8 0.6 04 0.2 0.0 OK 4K 8K 12K 16K 20K 24K 28K Seq Len Passkey Loc\\n3.8 â\\x80\\x94 Mixtral_8x7B 3.5 32 > $3.0 i] 228 fos a 2.0 0 5k 10k 15k 20k 25k 30k Context length\\nPasskey Performance ry 3.8 â\\x80\\x94 Mixtral_8x7B 3.5 0.8 32 > 0.6 $3.0 i] 228 04 fos 0.2 a 2.0 0.0 OK 4K 8K 12K 16K 20K 24K 28K 0 5k 10k 15k 20k 25k 30k Seq Len Context length\\nFigure 4: Long range performance of Mixtral.

BBQ is a dataset of hand-written question sets that target attested social biases against nine differ- ent socially-relevant categories: age, dis- ability status, gender identity, nationality, physical appearance, race/ethnicity, religion, socio-economic status, sexual orientation. BOLD is a large-scale dataset that consists of 23,679 English text generation prompts for bias benchmarking across five domains.\\nLlama 2 70B Mixtral 8x7B BBQ accuracy 51.5% 56.0% BOLD sentiment score (avg Â± std) gender profession religious_ideology political_ideology race 0.293 Â± 0.073 0.218 Â± 0.073 0.188 Â± 0.133 0.149 Â± 0.140 0.232 Â± 0.049 0.323 Â±0.045 0.243 Â± 0.087 0.144 Â± 0.089 0.186 Â± 0.146 0.232 Â± 0.052\\nFigure 5: Bias Benchmarks. Compared Llama 2 70B, Mixtral presents less bias (higher accuracy on BBQ, lower std on BOLD) and displays more positive sentiment (higher avg on BOLD).\\nWe benchmark Llama 2 and Mixtral on BBQ and BOLD with our evaluation framework and report the results in Table 5. Compared to Llama 2, Mixtral presents less bias on the BBQ benchmark (56.0% vs 51.5%). For each group in BOLD, a higher average sentiment score means more positive sentiments and a lower standard deviation indicates less bias within the group. Overall, Mixtral displays more positive sentiments than Llama 2, with similar variances within each group.\\n# Instruction Fine-tuning\\nWe train Mixtral â\\x80\\x93 Instruct using supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on an instruction dataset followed by Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) [25] on a paired feedback dataset. Mixtral â\\x80\\x93 Instruct reaches a score of 8.30 on MT-Bench [33] (see Table 2), making it the best open-weights model as of December 2023.

Mixtral is currently the best open-weights model by a large margin.\\n3https://huggingface.co/spaces/lmsys/chatbot-arena-leaderboard\\n6\\n# 5 Routing analysis\\nIn this section, we perform a small analysis on the expert selection by the router. In particular, we are interested to see if during training some experts specialized to some specific domains (e.g. mathematics, biology, philosophy, etc.).\\nTo investigate this, we measure the distribution of selected experts on different subsets of The Pile validation dataset [14]. Results are presented in Figure 7, for layers 0, 15, and 31 (layers 0 and 31 respectively being the first and the last layers of the model). Surprisingly, we do not observe obvious patterns in the assignment of experts based on the topic. For instance, at all layers, the distribution of expert assignment is very similar for ArXiv papers (written in Latex), for biology (PubMed Abstracts), and for Philosophy (PhilPapers) documents.\\nOnly for DM Mathematics we note a marginally different distribution of experts. This divergence is likely a consequence of the datasetâ\\x80\\x99s synthetic nature and its limited coverage of the natural language spectrum, and is particularly noticeable at the first and last layers, where the hidden states are very correlated to the input and output embeddings respectively.\\nThis suggests that the router does exhibit some structured syntactic behavior. Figure 8 shows examples of text from different domains (Python code, mathematics, and English), where each token is highlighted with a background color corresponding to its selected expert. The figure shows that words such as â\\x80\\x98selfâ\\x80\\x99 in Python and â\\x80\\x98Questionâ\\x80\\x99 in English often get routed through the same expert even though they involve multiple tokens. Similarly, in code, the indentation tokens are always assigned to the same experts, particularly at the first and last layers where the hidden states are more correlated to the input and output of the model.\\nWe also note from Figure 8 that consecutive tokens are often assigned the same experts. In fact, we observe some degree of positional locality in The Pile datasets. Table 5 shows the proportion of con- secutive tokens that get the same expert assignments per domain and layer. The proportion of repeated\\n0.20 0.15 0.10 0.05 layer: 15 0.20 0.15 0.10 0.05 layer: 31 Selection proportion 0.20 0.15 0.10 0.05 Expert ID | | ArXiv | Github | | PhilPapers | StackExchange | | DM Mathematics | | Gutenberg | | PubMed Abstracts | | Wikipedia (en)\\nFigure 7: Proportion of tokens assigned to each expert on different domains from The Pile dataset for layers 0, 15, and 31. The gray dashed vertical line marks 1/8, i.e. the proportion expected with uniform sampling. Here, we consider experts that are either selected as a first or second choice by the router. A breakdown of the proportion of assignments done in each case cane be seen in Figure 9 in the Appendix.\\n7\\nLayer 0 First choice Layer 15 Layer 31 Layer 0 First or second choice Layer 15 Layer 31 ArXiv DM Mathematics Github Gutenberg PhilPapers PubMed Abstracts StackExchange Wikipedia (en) 14.0% 14.1% 14.9% 13.9% 13.6% 14.2% 13.6% 14.4% 27.9% 28.4% 28.1% 26.1% 25.3% 24.6% 27.2% 23.6% 22.7% 19.7% 19.7% 26.3% 22.1% 22.0% 23.6% 25.3% 46.5% 44.9% 49.9% 49.5% 46.9% 48.6% 48.2% 49.8% 62.3% 67.0% 66.9% 63.1% 61.9% 61.6% 64.6% 62.1% 52.9% 44.5% 49.2% 52.2% 51.3% 51.8% 53.6% 51.8%\\nTable 5: Percentage of expert assignment repetitions. We evaluate the proportion of times the same expert is assigned to a token i and its following token i+1. We report whether the first chosen expert is the same, or whether the same expert is observed as first or second choice in consecutive tokens. For reference, the expected proportion of repetitions in the case of random assignments is 1 5 7 â\\x89\\x88 46% for â\\x80\\x9cFirst and second choiceâ\\x80\\x9d. Repetitions at the first layer are close to random, but are significantly higher at layers 15 and 31. The high number of repetitions shows that expert choice exhibits high temporal locality at these layers.\\nconsecutive assignments is significantly higher than random for higher layers. This has implications in how one might optimize the model for fast training and inference. For example, cases with high locality are more likely to cause over-subscription of certain experts when doing Expert Parallelism. Conversely, this locality can be leveraged for caching, as is done in [11]. A more complete view of these same expert frequency is provided for all layers and across datasets in Figure 10 in the Appendix.\\n# 6 Conclusion\\nIn this paper, we introduced Mixtral 8x7B, the first mixture-of-experts network to reach a state-of-the- art performance among open-source models. Mixtral 8x7B Instruct outperforms Claude-2.1, Gem- ini Pro, and GPT-3.5 Turbo on human evaluation benchmarks. Because it only uses two experts at each time step, Mixtral only uses 13B active parameters per token while outperforming the previous best model using 70B parameters per token (Llama 2 70B). We are making our trained and fine-tuned mod- els publicly available under the Apache 2.0 license. By sharing our models, we aim to facilitate the de- velopment of new techniques and applications that can benefit a wide range of industries and domains.\\nLayer 0 Layer 15 Layer 31 class MoeLayer(nn.

      "Mixture of Experts (MoE) models are a specialized architecture within the realm of deep learning, particularly designed to enhance the efficiency and scalability of neural networks, especially in comparison to regular transformer models. Here are the key differences:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Parameter Utilization**: MoE models utilize a sparse activation mechanism, where only a subset of the model's parameters (experts) is activated for each input. This allows MoE models to have a significantly larger number of parameters while maintaining a constant computational cost per input. In contrast, regular transformer models typically use the same parameters for all inputs, leading to a direct correlation between the number of parameters and the computational cost.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Dynamic Routing**: In MoE models, tokens are routed to different experts based on a gating mechanism, which can adaptively select which experts to activate for a given input. This dynamic routing allows MoE models to handle varying complexities of input data more effectively. Regular transformers do not have this dynamic routing; they process all inputs through the same set of parameters.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Training Efficiency**: MoE models can achieve significant training cost reductions compared to dense models of equivalent quality. For instance, some studies have shown that MoE models can save up to 5x in training costs for certain tasks. Regular transformers do not benefit from this level of efficiency due to their dense parameter usage.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Scalability**: MoE models are designed to scale to very large sizes (e.g., trillion-parameter models) while keeping computational costs manageable. This scalability is a significant advantage over regular transformers, which may face limitations in terms of hardware resources and training time as they grow larger.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Performance on Diverse Tasks**: MoE models have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance across various tasks, including natural language processing, computer vision, and speech recognition, by leveraging their ability to activate different experts for different inputs. Regular transformers may not achieve the same level of performance due to their fixed parameter usage.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Training Stability**: While MoE models offer advantages in terms of efficiency and scalability, they can also face challenges such as training instabilities and under-training of certain experts. Recent advancements in MoE architectures aim to address these issues, whereas regular transformers typically do not encounter such complexities.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, Mixture of Experts models provide a flexible, efficient, and scalable alternative to regular transformer models by utilizing a sparse activation mechanism, dynamic routing, and the ability to handle larger parameter counts without a corresponding increase in computational cost.\n"
