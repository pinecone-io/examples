The early phase, known as Web 1.0 (1989-2004), limited users' interaction primarily to reading and selecting web pages.\n",

            "\n",
            "As web applications became more complex, the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern was employed to separate a traditional web application's data model, presentation, and business logic layers:\n",
            "\n",
            "- Model: The persistence layer responsible for data storage and retrieval\n",
            "- View: The presentation layer that handles the user interface\n",
            "- Controller: Acts as the business logic layer that performs processing and enforces rules\n",
            "\n",
            "This pattern allows for loose coupling between components, which means weak associations with other components. This concept enables separation of concerns between components, leading to high cohesion within website functionalities.\n",
            "\n",
            "## Single-Page Applications (SPAs)\n",
            "\n",
            "By the mid-2000s, JavaScript became popular for client-side browser functionality. AJAX and jQuery technologies allowed developers to create single-page applications (SPAs). SPAs offered functionality like traditional desktop applications and improved user experience by reducing latency.\n",
            "\n",
            "In SPAs, a single web page is delivered to the browser, and small data transmissions are sent and received between the browser and server through AJAX instead of requiring full page refreshes.\n",
            "\n",
            "## Modern Web Application Frameworks\n",
            "\n",
            "To facilitate the creation and maintenance of web applications, web application frameworks and native application frameworks that leverage applicable patterns, such as MVC, were created and improved over the past couple of decades.\n",
            "\n",
            "Web frameworks help with using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript to publish responsive web pages that can be rendered by modern browsers on all modern target devices. Web application frameworks help process UI-driven requests that result in publishing or updating web pages.\n",
            "\n",
            "## Responsive Web Design\n",
            "\n",
            "Modern web applications are often designed to be responsive, meaning they render effectively in a browser regardless of the user's device screen or orientation. This approach allows developers to create applications that work well on various screen sizes, from large monitors to smaller displays like phones and tablets.\n",
            "\n",
            "By understanding these fundamental concepts, you can begin to grasp how simple web applications are architected and function in today's digital landscape.\n"

In this section, you\\nwill continue to use Bootstrap to create another simple Todo application. But instead of working with Django,\\nyou will use React and Node. React, or React.js, is a JavaScript library popular to build user interfaces.

Node serves as the back end,\\nusing a REST API built with ExpressJS and the MongooseJS Object Data Modeling (ODM) to interact with a\\nMongoDB database.\\nPrerequisites\\nTo build the Todo application using Bootstrap, React, and Node, you will need the following software\\ncomponents: React v17.0.2, Bootstrap v4.5.0, Node v14.17.5, ExpressJS v4.17.2, MongooseJS v6.1.9, and Axios\\nv0.21.0. To begin, download and install Node.\\nCreating the Node Back End\\nSeveral steps are needed to build the Node application back end required for the Todo application. This section\\nwill explain each of these steps.\\nLINK TO LEARNING\\nNode (https://openstax.org/r/76NodeJS) is a JavaScript runtime environment that provides users with the\\ntools to develop web applications, as well as servers, scripts, and command-line tools. Node, which is free,\\nis open-source and cross-platform. It was designed to develop network applications that are scalable,\\nmanaging many connections simultaneously. Unlike the typical inefficient concurrency model, with Node, a\\ncallback is fired with each connection, and Node sleeps unless work needs to be done.\\nCreating the Node App\\nBefore you can create the Todo application back end, you should create a Node app. To accomplish this, create\\nthe directory nodebackend/ and navigate into it. Next, run the following command to initialize the Node\\napplication:\\n$ npm init\\nAfter running this command, follow the prompt, which is highlighted in Figure 11.30.\\nFigure11.30 This prompt appears when the Node application is initialized. (attribution: Copyright Rice University, OpenStax, under\\nCC BY 4.0 license)\\n11.3 • Sample Responsive WAD with Bootstrap/React and Node 611After the Node application initialization is completed, a package.json file is generated, as shown in the\\nfollowing code.\\n{\\n\"name\": \"nodebackend\",\\n\"version\": \"1.0.0\",\\n\"description\": \"Todo Web application with Bootstrap, ReactJS and NodeJS\",\\n\"main\": \"server.js\",\\n\"scripts\": {\\n\"test\": \"echo \\\\\"Error: no test specified\\\\\" && exit 1\"\\n},\\n\"keywords\": [\\n\"bootstrap\",\\n\"reactjs\",\\n\"nodejs\",\\n\"express\",\\n\"mongodb\",\\n\"rest\",\\n\"api\"\\n],\\n\"author\": \"\",\\n\"license\": \"ISC\",\\n\"dependencies\": {\\n\"body-parser\": \"^1.19.1\",\\n\"cors\": \"^2.8.5\",\\n\"express\": \"^4.17.2\",\\n\"mongoose\": \"^6.1.9\"\\n}\\n}\\nSetting Up the Express Web Server\\nOnce the Node application is initialized, the next step is to set up the Express web server. To do this, use the\\nfollowing command to install Express, Mongoose (Mongoose is a library for MongoDB that is used to interact\\nwith MongoDB by facilitating the modeling of data as objects), and other dependent packages in the\\nnodebackend/ directory:\\n$ npm install express mongoose body-parser cors –save\\nNext, create the Express web server by going to the nodebackend/ directory, create the server.js file, and add\\nthe following code.\\nconst express = require(\"express\");\\nconst bodyParser = require(\"body-parser\");\\nconst cors = require(\"cors\");\\nconst app = express();\\nvar corsOptions = {\\norigin: \"http://localhost:8081\"\\n};\\n612 11 • Web Applications Development\\nAccess for free at openstax.orgapp.use(cors(corsOptions));\\n// parse requests of content-type - application/json\\napp.use(bodyParser.json());\\n// parse requests of content-type - application/x-www-form-urlencoded\\napp.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended: true }));\\n// routes\\napp.get(\"/\", (req, res) => {\\nres.json({ message: \"Welcome to the Todo Web App.\" });\\n});\\nrequire(\"./routes/todo.routes.js\")(app);\\n// set port, listen for requests\\nconst PORT = process.env.PORT || 8080;\\napp.listen(PORT, () => {\\nconsole.log(`Server is running on port ${PORT}.`);\\n});\\nOnce you use the code to import Express, you can build the REST APIs. The body-parser package is used to\\ncreate and parse the request object. The cors package is used to serve as middleware for Express that enables\\nCORS.

One way to do this would be to have\\nworkflow processes that require a high rate of change implemented in a Web 2.0 architecture, while processes\\nthat would benefit from using a distributed ledger being executed in Web 3.0. For example, traditional\\ncommercial websites can keep using the Web 2.0 architecture, while payment solutions can be extended by\\naccessing the Web 3.0 architecture to make payments using cryptocurrencies (e.g., Bitcoin).\\nLet’s consider an app for generating AI artwork. Many solutions exist today for doing this; however, we want\\nour app to give “ownership” to the digital artwork a person generates. AI models are trained to recognize\\nexisting artwork (e.g., paintings available via the wikiart.org API) that may be copyrighted—so o wnership is still\\nbeing determined in the courts. Here, the term ownership is used to attribute AI image creation and nothing\\nmore. While AI models are very popular, some companies do not want to share data with AI model creators\\nand prefer to have the AI models deployed in their own infrastructure to ensure full privacy. A non-fungible\\ntoken (NFT)is a unique digital identifier on a blockchain that a user may want to create of their image and\\npossibly sell (i.e., transfer ownership) on a marketplace. A common use case for this app might be:\\n1. A user logs in to the website and enters a prompt to generate an image.\\n2. After several rounds of adjusting their prompts, they end up with an image they want.\\n3. The user pays to have a non-fungible token created of the image, which is stored on a blockchain\\nmarketplace for sale.\\nAs you can imagine, running an AI image generator on a blockchain might not perform well. Likewise, creating\\nNFTs without blockchain technologies is counterintuitive. Therefore, the architecture for this solution needs to\\nencompass both Web 2.0 and 3.0 approaches.\\nFigure 11.13 shows how the APIs will do the heavy lifting of working with the AI model to generate the\\nartwork. Once the user is satisfied, they will interact with aspects of the UI that execute smart contracts to\\ngenerate and add the NFT to the blockchain. Transactions will happen on the blockchain. APIs may interact\\ndirectly with the blockchain, looking for similar works.\\n582 11 • Web Applications Development\\nAccess for free at openstax.orgFigure11.13 This outlines the user’s interaction with a hybrid Web 2.0/3.0 application.

To accomplish this, you will use Bootstrap\\nand Django. Bootstrap is an open-source, responsive web application framework, and Django is a Python-\\nbased web application development framework. Both frameworks are highly popular due to their ease of use.\\nCreating a Todo Web Application with Bootstrap and Django\\nThe Todo web application in this subsection uses Bootstrap and Django. Bootstrap’s CSS templates are used\\nfor the UI features. Django serves as both the front end and back end. Django templates are part of the user\\ninterface to get and set data via HTTP requests. Incoming requests are then handled by an API built using the\\nDjango REST Framework.\\nPrerequisites\\nTo build the Todo application, you must install Python, PIP, Django, Django REST Framework, Bootstrap, and\\njQuery.

It offers high-\\norder language features, making it easier to develop software and built-in memory management, which\\nmakes less prone to crash.\\nINDUSTRY SPOTLIGHT\\nFramework Selection Based on Industry\\nNative application frameworks are important in every industry today. For example, mobile health\\napplications have become quite popular. Smartwatches can collect health-related data using various\\nsensors and mobile health applications can leverage that data to provide useful reports to users as they\\nexercise. Using a native application framework provides quicker load times, smooth animations and\\ntransitions, optimal security, and a seamless user experience, to make it easier to immediately track and\\naccess health-care data.\\nDrawbacks to using native application framework include a longer development process, increased cost,\\ncomplex maintenance and updates, platform dependency, regulatory and compliance issues, and end-user\\nbarriers.\\nThe Benefits and Drawbacks Between Native, Web, and Hybrid Mobile Application\\nDevelopment\\nNative applications have the benefits of accessing device-specific hardware and sensors (e.g., camera,\\naccelerometer), data (e.g., location, contacts), and are optimized for performance.\\nHowever, they have the drawbacks of being device-dependent and available primarily through proprietary app\\nstores (Google Play for Android and Apple’s App Store for iOS). Developers need to learn different languages\\nand libraries for the devices. However, cross-platform development is possible with frameworks (e.g., Flutter,\\nKotlin Multiplatform Mobile), allowing developers to code in a single language and run solutions on both\\nplatforms.\\nWeb apps can also run in a browser on mobile devices. They have the distinct advantage of responsiveness\\nand can run on various screen sizes—thus allo wing for a single codebase that can increase productivity and\\nreduce cost. Disadvantages to web apps on mobile devices are limited access to hardware and software\\nfeatures, lower performance than native apps, and web apps may perform differently depending on the\\nmobile browser. Traditionally, web apps didn’t look like native apps. In 2017, Google introduced Progressive\\nWeb Apps for Android, allowing web apps to look and feel similar to native apps.\\nFinally, hybrid apps are web apps wrapped inside a native device framework (e.g., Apache Cordova). These\\napps have the advantages of using traditional web application development while accessing and utilizing\\ndevice functions and running on multiple mobile platforms. The drawbacks are reduced speed and potential\\nsecurity vulnerabilities found in the framework.\\n11.1 • Modern Web Applications Architectures 575CONCEPTS IN PRACTICE\\nSoftware Patterns and Frameworks\\nAs discussed in Chapter 9 Software Engineering and Chapter 10 Enterprise and Solution Architectures\\nManagement, architectural styles, architectural patterns, and design patterns are typically used to enforce\\nthe quality attributes of software solutions. To facilitate the creation and maintenance of web applications\\nand scalable transactional websites, web application frameworks and native application frameworks that\\nleverage applicable patterns, such as MVC, were created and improved over the past couple of decades.\\nWeb frameworks are used within web application frameworks to facilitate the use of HTML5, CSS3, and\\nJavaScript and to publish responsive web pages that can be rendered by modern browsers on all modern\\ntarget devices. Web application frameworks help process UI-driven requests that result in publishing or\\nupdating web pages. Native application frameworks take advantage of capabilities available on specific\\ntarget devices such as iPhones and Android phones. Organizations in many industries rely on web\\napplications and related frameworks to conduct business daily.\\nWeb 3.0 Applications\\nWeb 3.0 is the next phase of the Web. It is still being realized, and similar to Web 1.0 and 2.0, it can only be\\nfully understood in hindsight. The technology and uses of the Web overlap between the phases, with newer\\nphases becoming preferred over their predecessor phases. If Web 1.0 was the read-only web, and Web 2.0 was\\nthe participation (write) web, then Web 3.0 may be the read, write, and execute web.\\nTim Berners-Lee had referred to Web 3.0 as the Semantic Web, a system of autonomous agents, which are\\nsoftware programs that respond to events. That model has shifted over the years. While AI (and other\\ntechnologies such as AR/VR) will likely form a part of Web 3.0 or Web x.0, the principles that govern the next\\nphase are expected to be around a web that is decentralized, permissionless, and trusted.\\nWeb 3.0 sees a shift from the more traditional client-server model to a peer-to-peer networking model. A peer-\\nto-peer network is one in which devices connect and can share data and processing without needing a\\ncentralized server. Peers in this scheme can perform the role of a traditional client, server, or both. This shift\\nwill foster a trusted, decentralized, and open web, where large companies don’t own the data, but everyone\\ncollectively owns it. Technologies such as a smart contract allow a trusted model that is needed in a\\ndecentralized system. Artificial intelligence and machine learning will improve information access through\\nunderstanding the meaning of content available on the Web.

This section will outline the\\nsteps to do this.\\nInstalling Bootstrap\\nThe first step to create a UI is to install Bootstrap, which, as an open-source, responsive web application\\nframework, can be used in web applications like Django to create UIs. To install Bootstrap in a Django\\napplication, you have several options. In this scenario, an efficient method is to download the Bootstrap CSS\\nand JS files and add them to the static/ directory, as shown in Figure 11.26. To do this, first create the static/\\ndirectory in the Django project directory. In addition, to install jQuery, download the JS file and add it to the\\nstatic/ directory. Finally, add a custom CSS file to include individual style in the Django web application.\\n596 11 • Web Applications Development\\nAccess for free at openstax.orgFigure11.26 An efficient method to install Bootstrap in a Django application is to download the Bootstrap CSS and JS files and add\\nthem to the static/ directory.

The View function is also needed to interact with the database to both create and delete todo\\nitems.\\nTo create the View, open the todo/views.py file and add the code shown in the following code snippet. This\\ncode takes an HTTP request object. If the request method is POST, a todo item is either created or deleted,\\ndepending on which button is clicked.

One application is an AI-image\\ngenerator website and auction house for selling images. An outside consultant has been brought in, and they\\nhave determined that a hybrid Web 2.0/3.0 architecture is best suited for this solution. However, the\\nengineering team who will perform the work needs to gain experience with Web 3.0 technologies. Therefore,\\nthe consultant recommended that TechWorks take a popular internal desktop application for managing to-do\\nlists and re-create it as a hybrid Web 2.0/3.0-based application so engineers can gain practical experience with\\nvarious web application frameworks and technologies, with the added benefit of accessing their to-dos from\\nanywhere.\\nThe TechWorks engineering team has decided to perform iterative releases of the to-do application, starting\\nwith responsive web apps, as they will render well on various screen sizes, from large monitors to smaller\\ndisplays like phones and tablets. Next, they will employ a native web application framework to target specific\\ndevices like Android and iPhones. Lastly, they will explore building a Web 2.0/3.0-based to-do application using\\nblockchain technology, as they believe this approach will give them the necessary skills for creating future\\nsolutions.\\nWeb Applications Development\\n11\\n11.1 Modern Web Applications Architectures\\nLearning Objectives\\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\\n• Understand the use of server-side rendering and MVC patterns\\n• Relate to the technology used to create responsive Web 2.0 applications\\n• Become familiar with the technology used to create native mobile applications\\n• Understand how to create Web 3.0 applications as well as hybrid Web 2.0/3.0 applications\\nThe World Wide Web, or the Webas it is known today, started as a way to link content (primarily text and\\nimages) stored on different servers or machines. It was invented by Tim Berners-Lee in 1989 while he worked\\nas a researcher at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN), home to the European Particle\\nPhysics Laboratory. Sir Tim Berners-Lee was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II in 2004 for his pioneering work. He\\ncreated the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) that operates on top of Transmission Control Protocol/Internet\\nProtocol (TCP/IP), the principal protocols used on the Internet. Clients (web browsers) transmit HTTP requests\\nto a web server, which is a software application that runs at a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) that specifies a\\nlocation on the Web to access it, and responds by providing pages rendered in the hypertext markup language\\n(HTML). This simple request and response paradigm, a client-server model, was easy to implement and\\nallowed for the rapid growth of the Web. This phase of the Web, which began after 1989 and ended around\\n2004, would become known as Web 1.0, a period where the user’s interaction was limited primarily to reading\\nand selecting web pages. A web pageis a document commonly written in HTML and viewed in a browser.\\nFigure 11.2 shows a simple Web 1.0 architecture and common usage. An encryption layer was later added to\\nthe HTTP protocol, which resulted in creating the HTTPS protocol. This made it possible to protect the sharing\\nof sensitive information over the Web from eavesdropping attacks. While web servers only served web pages\\ninitially, a Common Gateway Interface (CGI) was subsequently added after the initial implementation of web\\nservers to make it possible to link to applications via URLs on the Web.\\nFigure11.2 This architecture outlines a user’s interaction with a Web 1.0 website. (attribution: Copyright Rice University, OpenStax,\\nunder CC BY 4.0 license)\\nAs the Web evolved from this basic architecture, the need for more dynamic and interactive experiences\\nbecame apparent. Users were no longer content with simply viewing static pages; they wanted to contribute\\ncontent and engage with other users. Also called online publishing, web publishingpublishes content on the\\nWeb while applying traditional publishing models. It was akin to digitizing an encyclopedia (images and text)\\n566 11 • Web Applications Development\\nAccess for free at openstax.organd putting it online with hyperlinks.

Peers in this scheme can perform the role of a\\ntraditional client, server, or both. This shift fosters a trusted, decentralized, and open web, where large\\ncompanies do not own the data, but rather where data is collectively owned by users. The use of other\\ntechnologies like generative artificial intelligence (GenAI), which is powered by machine learning, aims to\\n11.1 • Modern Web Applications Architectures 567improve information access by mediating end-user searches to generate corresponding meaningful\\ninformation out of the content available on the Web. While the benefits of artificial intelligence and machine\\nlearning are vast, enabling enhanced data processing and decision-making, it is equally important to consider\\nthe risks. These technologies can pose ethical concerns, such as data privacy issues, biased algorithms, and\\nthe potential for misuse, thus highlighting the importance of responsible development and implementation. In\\nparticular, while GenAI technology is appealing and can be successful in some cases, GenAI is also known to\\nhallucinate and generate unpredictable and often inaccurate responses to web searches. The exemplar apps\\nof the Web 3.0 and later phases are still to be determined. Still, if the previous phases of the Web are any\\nindication, it will fundamentally change how we operate in an ever-evolving technological world.\\nThroughout this section, we will discover how the application architectures found in Web 2.0 apps, native\\nmobile apps, and Web 3.0 apps are designed.\\nGLOBAL ISSUES IN TECHNOLOGY\\nImportance of Internationalization and Localization in Frameworks\\nWeb applications are used worldwide, and specific internationalization and localization requirements must\\nbe observed to facilitate the creation of web applications that people all over the world can use. This can be\\nchallenging. To meet internationalization and localization prerequisites, services and products must be\\nflexible to compete in international markets. This includes having the malleability to adapt to the cultural\\nneeds of target markets around the world. In global markets, language barriers are just one\\ninternationalization and localization issue that must be considered for web applications.1\\nServer-Side Rendering and MVC Patterns\\nThe Web transitioned from its 1.0 phase, where the primary usage was viewing content composed of text and\\nimages, to its 2.0 phase of user interaction. As it evolved, three technologies dominated the Web’s\\nprogramming landscape, commonly referred to as the trifecta:\\n• hypertext markup language (HTML): a standard markup language used to describe the structure and\\ncontent of web pages.\\n• cascading style sheets (CSS): a standard style sheet language used to alter the presentation style of the\\ncontent found in HTML (or other markup languages).\\n• JavaScript (JS): a scripting language that adds interactivity to web content and server-side functionality.\\nVarious other scripting languages and competing approaches were used prior to the adoption of\\nJavaScript.\\nThe adoption of HTML was already a given on the Web, and with the introduction of CSS in 1996, a stronger\\npush for separating content and style was introduced so that the styling of content could be specified solely as\\npart of style sheets rather than HTML tags. Web pages at this time mostly consisted of static content, which\\nwould be generated and delivered on the web server. Essentially, the user would select an action in their\\nbrowser that sent an HTTP request to the server such as the following:\\n• When clicking a hyperlink on a web page, the browser would send an HTTP GET request to the web server.\\nThis request asked for a specific resource (such as a web page or an image), and the server would respond\\nby sending the requested data back to the browser.\\n• When filling out a form on a web page and clicking the submit button, the browser would send an HTTP\\nPOST request to the server. This request included the data that was entered (like a username and\\npassword), and the server processed it and responded accordingly.\\n1 To learn more, check out Lionbridge’s blog (https://openstax.org/r/76Lionbridge) post about globalization.\\n568 11 • Web Applications Development\\nAccess for free at openstax.orgEssentially, the web server performed all the HTML content rendering on the server side, and the client (web\\nbrowser) would present what it received. The browser in this model acts as a thin client, as it has minimal\\nfunctionality. Figure 11.4 illustrates the components of a traditional Web 2.0 architecture using Java-based\\ntechnologies. Notice the shift in user interaction with the website compared with a Web 1.0 website. Also note\\nthat users are able to interact with applications via an application server that can retrieve data from a database\\nor file system. This enables support for managing web sessions that allow navigation across multiple pages.\\nFigure11.4 This illustrates a user’s interaction with a traditional Web 2.0 architecture. (attribution: Copyright Rice University,\\nOpenStax, under CC BY 4.0 license)\\nMany of the original web applications were stateless, meaning that prior requests had no bearing on future\\nrequests. For example, it was not possible to create a shopping cart as part of a web session that would keep\\ntrack of the session and what was purchased on a site and maintain the state (i.e., content in this case) of the\\ncart. In contrast, a stateful applicationis software that maintains the state of an application over time, while\\nin the case of a stateless application, state is not maintained by the system and previous actions do not\\nimpact future ones. Stateless applications are simpler and easier to implement and maintain but offer limited\\nfunctionality.\\nAs previously mentioned, Web 2.0 was partly driven by user demand for more interactive functionality.\\nInteractivity requires maintaining some state (e.g., the web session and the content of the cart as per the\\nprevious example), thereby increasing the system’s complexity. This increased the demands on the web server\\nfor almost all the processing needed to generate and present the website content. Increased functionality led\\nto more complex systems, and a clear separation of responsibility between the website’s rendition, business\\nlogic (i.e., the logic implemented as part of the web application), and persistence layers were needed to\\nimprove the quality and performance of the website while leveraging engineering expertise in given domains.\\nAs you learned in Chapter 10 Enterprise and Solution Architectures Management, the Model-View-Controller\\npattern is tailored to address this separation of responsibility.

This section will review the steps required to update the Todo web application\\nusing Bootstrap with React and Django.\\nUpdating the Todo Web Application with Bootstrap, React, and Django\\nIn this section, the Todo web application implemented will build on the Django application covered in 11.2\\nSample Responsive WAD with Bootstrap and Django, as well as the React application explored in 11.3 Sample\\nResponsive WAD with Bootstrap/React and Node. For this version of the Todo web application, React serves as\\nthe front end handling the user interface to get and set data via HTTP requests. Django serves as the back end.\\n11.4 • Sample Responsive WAD with Bootstrap/React and Django 625Prerequisites\\nTo build this version of the Todo application, you need Python v3.9.4, PIP v21.3.1, Django v4.0.1, Django REST\\nFramework v3.13.1, Bootstrap v4.5.0, Django-cors-headers v3.11.0, React v17.0.2, and Axios v0.21.0. To begin,\\ncomplete the following steps:\\n• Activate the venv used in section 11A.2:\\n$ cd py394venv\\nWindows: $ source ./Scripts/activate\\nmacOS: $ source ./bin/activate\\n• Install in the local programming environment Django Cors Headers\\n$ pip install django-cors-headers==3.11.0 ]\\nLINK TO LEARNING\\nWhen using Django, Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) headers (https://openstax.org/r/\\n76CORSheaders) can be a valuable tool to allow a Django application to accept in-browser requests that\\ncome from other origins. With CORS headers, other domains can access your resources, but only if\\npermitted. When used appropriately, this makes CORS an important tool to boost a website’s security.\\nExtending the Django Back End to Support the React Front End\\nTo create a Todo web application using React as a front end to the Django back end, the Django project\\nrequires a couple of configurations. Open TodoApp/settings.py and add ‘corsheaders’ to INSTALLED_APPS as in\\nthe following code.\\nINSTALLED _APPS = [\\n\\'django.contrib.admin\\',\\n\\'django.contrib.auth\\',\\n\\'django.contrib.contenttypes\\',\\n\\'django.contrib.sessions\\',\\n\\'django.contrib.messages\\',\\n\\'django.contrib.staticfiles\\',\\n\\'corsheaders\\',\\n\\'rest_framework\\',\\n\\'todo\\',\\n]\\nBy configuring the Django project with CORS, the Django application will be allowed to accept in-browser\\nrequests that come from other origins. To add CORS, add the CORS middleware to MIDDLEWARE, as shown in\\nthe following code.\\nMIDDLEWARE = [\\n\\'django.middleware.security.SecurityMiddleware\\',\\n\\'django.contrib.sessions.middleware.SessionMiddleware\\',\\n\\'django.middleware.common.CommonMiddleware\\',\\n\\'django.middleware.csrf.CsrfViewMiddleware\\',\\n\\'django.contrib.auth.middleware.AuthenticationMiddleware\\',\\n\\'django.contrib.messages.middleware.MessageMiddleware\\',\\n\\'django.middleware.clickjacking.XFrameOptionsMiddleware\\',\\n\\'corsheaders.middleware.CorsMiddleware\\',\\n626 11 • Web Applications Development\\nAccess for free at openstax.org]\\nAfter completing this step, scroll to the bottom of the settings.py file and add the following variable.\\n# add CORS whitelist for localhost:3000 since the React frontend will be served on\\nport 3000\\nCORS_ORIGIN_WHITELIST = [\\n\\'http://localhost:3000\\'\\n]\\nLINK TO LEARNING\\nAxios is an HTTP client for Node that manages asynchronous HTTP requests. Axios is free and open-source,\\nwith built-in security measures. Axios uses clean, efficient syntax to manage promises, and works well with\\nNode, as well as browser environments. Visit this page on Axios (https://openstax.org/r/76Axios) to learn\\nmore.\\nConnecting the React Front End to the Django Back End\\nNext, the React application must be configured so it can make requests to the API endpoints of the Django\\napplication. The React application uses Axios to fetch data by making requests to a given endpoint. To install\\nAxios, run the following command in the reactfrontend/ directory:\\n$ npm install axios@0.21.1\\nNext, add a proxy to the Django application. The proxy will help tunnel API requests from the React application\\nto http://localhost:8000, where the Django application will receive and handle the requests. To add the proxy,\\nopen the reactfrontend/package.json file and add the following code.\\n{\\n\"name\": \"reactfrontend\",\\n\"version\": \"0.1.0\",\\n\"private\": true,\\n\"proxy\": \"http://localhost:8080\",\\n\"dependencies\": {\\nAfter completing this step, open the reactfrontend/src/App.js file and import Axios, as shown in the following\\ncode.\\nimport \\'./App.css\\';\\nimport React, { Component } from \"react\";\\nimport Modal from \"./components/Modal\";\\nimport Nav from \"./components/NavComponent\";\\nimport axios from \"axios\";\\nimport { Button, Form, FormGroup, Label, Input } from \\'reactstrap\\';\\nTo update the reactfrontend/src/App.js file, add the following code. The handleSubmit()function will use\\nAxios to make requests to the Django API endpoints to create and delete todo items.\\nhandleSubmit = (item) => {\\nthis.toggle();\\n11.4 • Sample Responsive WAD with Bootstrap/React and Django 6\\nCited Pages: 634, 635, 636, 637\\n\\nSnippet 16:\\n is deleted.
