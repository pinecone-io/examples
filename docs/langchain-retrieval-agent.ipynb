    "We've seen in previous chapters how powerful [retrieval augmentation](https://www.pinecone.io/learn/series/langchain/langchain-retrieval-augmentation/) and [conversational agents](https://www.pinecone.io/learn/series/langchain/langchain-agents/) can be. They become even more impressive when we begin using them together.\n",

      "# Understanding Algorithms\n",
      "\n",
      "## What is an Algorithm?\n",
      "\n",
      "An algorithm is a sequence of precise instructions that takes any input and computes the corresponding output. It's essentially a step-by-step procedure that must be followed in a specific order to solve a problem. Computer programs typically execute algorithms to perform certain tasks.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Key Characteristics of Algorithms\n",
      "\n",
      "For an algorithm to be effective, it must have several key characteristics:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Unambiguous**: Each step of the algorithm must be very well defined and precise.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Deterministic**: The algorithm must be reproducible and repeatable so that the same set of inputs produce the same output.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Efficient**: The algorithm must consume a reasonable amount of time and storage based on the problem needs. An algorithm can be finite and precise, but if it requires 100 years to generate a result, it is clearly useless.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Historical Context\n",
      "\n",
      "The concept of an algorithm was invented thousands of years ago alongside early number systems. Algorithms use inputs and a finite number of steps to carry out arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, and produce outputs used in computing. Today's computers still rely on the same foundations of numbers, calculations, and algorithms, except at the scale of billions of numbers and billions of calculations per second.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Algorithmic Problem-Solving\n",
      "\n",
      "Algorithmic problem-solving refers to a particular set of approaches and methods for designing algorithms that draws on computing's historical connections to the study of mathematical problem solving. Early computer scientists were influenced by mathematical formalism and mathematical problem solving.\n",
      "\n",
      "The goal of algorithmic problem-solving is to find an \"efficient\" solution, either in terms of execution time (e.g., number of computer instructions) or space used (e.g., computer memory size). The study emphasizes the formal problem or task, with specific input data and output data corresponding to each input.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Types of Algorithms\n",
      "\n",
      "There are several categories of computational problems that algorithms address:\n",
      "\n",
      "### 1. Data Structure Problems\n",
      "These involve the storage and retrieval of elements for implementing abstract data types such as lists, sets, maps, and priority queues. Examples include:\n",
      "- **Searching**: Retrieving a target element from a collection of elements\n",
      "- **Sorting**: Rearranging elements into a logical order\n",
      "- **Hashing**: Assigning a meaningful integer index for each object\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2. Graph Problems\n",
      "These involve graphs that represent relationships between data. Examples include:\n",
      "- **Traversal**: Exploring all the vertices in a graph\n",
      "- **Minimum spanning tree**: Finding a lowest-cost way to connect all the vertices to each other\n",
      "- **Shortest path**: Finding the lowest-cost way to get from one vertex to another\n",
      "\n",
      "### 3. String Problems\n",
      "These involve text or information represented as a sequence of characters. Examples include:\n",
      "- **Matching**: Searching for a text pattern within a document\n",
      "- **Compression**: Representing information using less data storage\n",
      "- **Cryptography**: Masking or obfuscating text to make it unintelligible\n",
      "\n",
      "## Algorithm Execution Models\n",
      "\n",
      "Various patterns of execution models may be used to step through the instructions provided in an algorithm:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Sequential Execution**: The traditional step-by-step execution model\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Parallel/Concurrent Execution**: Used to optimize algorithm execution efficiency. For example, if you and a friend are buying tickets for a movie and there are three independent lines, you may opt for a parallel processing model by having you and your friend join two separate lines.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Recursion**: A problem-solving technique where a process calls itself to solve smaller instances of the same problem. It allows for elegant solutions to complex problems by breaking them down into smaller, more manageable parts.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Representing Algorithms\n",
      "\n",
      "Algorithms are most commonly written as either pseudocode or a flowchart:\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Pseudocode**: An outline of the logic of algorithms using a combination of language and high-level programming concepts. Each step is shown in a clearly ordered, written structure.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Flowchart**: Clearly shows the flow and direction of decisions in a visual way using a diagram.\n",
      "\n",
      "By understanding these fundamental concepts, you can begin to appreciate how algorithms form the foundation of modern computing and problem-solving.\n"

      "['Snippet 1:\\nstry today. For example, mobile health\\r\\napplications have become quite popular. Smartwatches can collect health-related data using various\\r\\nsensors and mobile health applications can leverage that data to provide useful reports to users as they\\r\\nexercise. Using a native application framework provides quicker load times, smooth animations and\\r\\ntransitions, optimal security, and a seamless user experience, to make it easier to immediately track and\\r\\naccess health-care data.\\r\\nDrawbacks to using native application framework include a longer development process, increased cost,\\r\\ncomplex maintenance and updates, platform dependency, regulatory and compliance issues, and end-user\\r\\nbarriers.\\r\\nThe Benefits and Drawbacks Between Native, Web, and Hybrid Mobile Application\\r\\nDevelopment\\r\\nNative applications have the benefits of accessing device-specific hardware and sensors (e.g., camera,\\r\\naccelerometer), data (e.g., location, contacts), and are optimized for performance.\\r\\nHowever, they have the drawbacks of being device-dependent and available primarily through proprietary app\\r\\nstores (Google Play for Android and Apple\u2019s App Store for iOS). Developers need to learn different languages\\r\\nand libraries for the devices. However, cross-platform development is possible with frameworks (e.g., Flutter,\\r\\nKotlin Multiplatform Mobile), allowing developers to code in a single language and run solutions on both\\r\\nplatforms.\\r\\nWeb apps can also run in a browser on mobile devices. They have the distinct advantage of responsiveness\\r\\nand can run on various screen sizes\u2014thus allowing for a single codebase that can increase productivity and\\r\\nreduce cost. Disadvantages to web apps on mobile devices are limited access to hardware and software\\r\\nfeatures, lower performance than native apps, and web apps may perform differently depending on the\\r\\nmobile browser. Traditionally, web apps didn\u2019t look like native apps. In 2017, Google introduced Progressive\\r\\nWeb Apps for Android, allowing web apps to look and feel similar to native apps.\\r\\nFinally, hybrid apps are web apps wrapped inside a native device framework (e.g., Apache Cordova). These\\r\\napps have the advantages of using traditional web application development while accessing and utilizing\\r\\ndevice functions and running on multiple mobile platforms. The drawbacks are reduced speed and potential\\r\\nsecurity vulnerabilities found in the framework.\\r\\n11.1 \u2022 Modern Web Applications Architectures 575CONCEPTS IN PRACTICE\\r\\nSoftware Patterns and Frameworks\\r\\nAs discussed in Chapter 9 Software Engineering and Chapter 10 Enterprise and Solution Architectures\\r\\nManagement, architectural styles, architectural patterns, and design patterns are typically used to enforce\\r\\nthe quality attributes of software solutions. To facilitate the creation and maintenance of web applications\\r\\nand scalable transactional websites, web application frameworks and native application frameworks that\\r\\nleverage applicable patterns, such as MVC, were created and improved over the past couple of decades.\\r\\nWeb frameworks are used within web application frameworks to facilitate the use of HTML5, CSS3, and\\r\\nJavaScript and to publish responsive web pages that can be rendered by modern browsers on all modern\\r\\ntarget devices. Web application frameworks help process UI-driven requests that result in publishing or\\r\\nupdating web pages. Native application frameworks take advantage of capabilities available on specific\\r\\ntarget devices such as iPhones and Android phones. Organizations in many industries rely on web\\r\\napplications and related frameworks to conduct business daily.\\r\\nWeb 3.0 Applications\\r\\nWeb 3.0 is the next phase of the Web. It is still being realized, and similar to Web 1.0 and 2.0, it can only be\\r\\nfully understood in hindsight. The technology and uses of the Web overlap between the phases, with newer\\r\\nphases becoming preferred over their predecessor phases. If Web 1.0 was the read-only web, and Web 2.0 was\\r\\nthe participation (write) web, then Web 3.0 may be the read, write, and execute web.\\r\\nTim Berners-Lee had referred to Web 3.0 as the Semantic Web, a system of autonomous agents, which are\\r\\nsoftware programs that respond to events. That model has shifted over the years. While AI (and other\\r\\ntechnologies such as AR/VR) will likely form a part of Web 3.0 or Web x.0, the principles that govern the next\\r\\nphase are expected to be around a web that is decentralized, permissionless, and trusted.\\r\\nWeb 3.0 sees a shift from the more traditional client-server model to a peer-to-peer networking model. A peer\\x02to-peer network is one in which devices connect and can share data and processing without needing a\\r\\ncentralized server. Peers in this scheme can perform the role of a traditional client, server, or both. This shift\\r\\nwill foster a trusted, decentralized, and open web, where large companies don\u2019t own the data, but everyone\\r\\ncollectively owns it. Technologies such as a smart contract allow a trusted model that is needed in a\\r\\ndecentralized system.

The processorcan\\nbe regarded as the computer\u2019s \u201cbrain,\u201d as it follows instructions from algorithms and processes data. The\\nmemoryis a means of addressing information in a computer by storing it in consistent locations, while the\\nnetworkrefers to the various technological devices that are connected and share information. The hardware\\nand physical components of a computer that permanently house a computer\u2019s data are called storage.\\nOne way to understand computers is from a hardware perspective: computers leverage digital electronics and\\nthe physics of materials used to develop transistors. For example, many of today\u2019s computers rely on the\\nphysical properties of a brittle, crystalline metalloid called silicon, which makes it suitable for representing\\ninformation. The batteries that power many of today\u2019s smartphones and mobile devices rely on lithium, a soft,\\nsilvery metal mostly harvested from minerals in Australia, Zimbabwe, and Brazil, as well as from continental\\nbrine deposits in Chile, Argentina, and Bolivia. Computer engineers combine these substances to build\\ncircuitry and information pathways at the microscopic scale to form the physical basis for modern computers.\\nHowever, the physical basis of computers was not always silicon. The Electronic Numerical Integrator and\\nComputer (ENIAC) was completed in 1945, making it one of the earliest digital computers. The ENIAC operated\\non different physical principles. Instead of silicon, the ENIAC used the technology of a vacuum tube, a physical\\ndevice like a light bulb that was used as memory in early digital computers. When the \u201clight\u201d in the vacuum\\ntube is off, the vacuum tube represents the number 0. When the \u201clight\u201d is on, the vacuum tube represents the\\nnumber 1. When thousands of vacuum tubes are combined in a logical way, we suddenly have memory. The\\nENIAC is notable in computer history because it was the first general-purpose computer, meaning that it could\\nrun not just a single program but rather any program specified by a programmer. The ENIAC was often run\\nand programmed by women programmers (Figure 1.4). Despite its age and differences in hardware properties,\\nit shares a fundamental and surprising similarity with modern computers. Anything that can be computed on\\n1.1 \u2022 Computer Science 13today\u2019s computers can also be computed by the ENIAC given the right circumstances\u2014just trillions of times\\nmore slowly.\\nFigure1.4 This image depicts women programmers holding boards used in computers such as the ENIAC, many of which were\\ndesigned expressly for ballistics and ordinance guidance research. Today, these room-size computers can be reproduced at a literally\\nmicroscopic scale\u2014basically invisible to the human e ye. (credit: modification of \"Women holding parts of the first four Army\\ncomputers\" by U.S. Army/Wikimedia Commons, Public Domain)\\nHow is this possible? The algorithmic principles that determine how results are computed makes up software.\\nAlmost all computers, from the ENIAC to today\u2019s computers, are considered Turing-complete(or\\nComputationally Universal, as opposed to specialized computing devices such as scientific calculators) because\\nthey share the same fundamental model for computing results and every computer has the ability to run any\\nalgorithm. Alan Mathison Turing was an English mathematician who was highly influential in the development\\nof theoretical computer science, which focuses on the mathematical processes behind software, and provided\\na formalization of the concepts of algorithm and computation with the Turing machine. A Turing-complete\\ncomputer stores data in memory (either using vacuum tubes or silicon) and manipulates that data according\\nto a computer program, which is an algorithm that can be run on a computer. These programs are\\nrepresented using symbols and instructions written in a programming languageconsisting of symbols and\\ninstructions that can be interpreted by the computer. Programs are also stored in memory, which allows\\nprogrammers to modify and improve programs by changing the instructions.\\nWhile both hardware and software are important to the practical operation of computers, computer science\u2019s\\nhistorical roots in mathematics also emphasize a third perspective. Whereas software focuses on the program\\ndetails for solving problems with computers, theoretical computer science focuses on the mathematical\\nprocesses behind software. The idea of Turing-completeness is a foundational concept in theoretical computer\\nscience, which considers how computers in general\u2014not just the ENIAC or today\u2019s computers, but even\\ntomorrow\u2019s computers that we haven\u2019t yet invented\u2014can solve pr oblems. This theoretical perspective expands\\ncomputer science knowledge by contributing ideas about (1) whether a problem can be computed by a Turing-\\ncomplete computer at all, (2) how that problem might be computed using an algorithm, and (3) how quickly or\\nefficiently a computer can run such an algorithm. The answers to these questions suggest the limits of what\\nwe can achieve with computers from a technical perspective: Using mathematical ideas, is it possible to use a\\ncomputer to compute all problems? If the answer to a problem is yes, how much of a computing resource is\\nneeded to get the answer?\\nClearly both humans and computers have their strengths and limitations. An example of a problem that\\nhumans can solve but computers struggle with is interpreting subtle emotions or making moral judgments in\\ncomplex social situations. While computers can process data and recognize patterns, they cannot fully\\nunderstand the nuances of human emotions or ethics, which often involve context, empathy, and experience.\\n14 1 \u2022 Introduction to Computer Science\\nAccess for free at openstax.orgOn the flip side, there are tasks that neither computers nor humans can perform, such as accurately predicting\\nchaotic systems like long-term weather patterns.

Recall that we compared calculators whose algorithms operated on\\r\\nnumbers with the idea of a computer whose algorithms operated on complex data. Data structures can be\\r\\nused to represent complex data by modeling hierarchy and relationships.\\r\\nWe might represent an online retail store as a map associating each item with details such as an image, a brief\\r\\ndescription, price, and the number of items in stock. This map makes some online storefront features easier to\\r\\nimplement than others. Given an item, this map makes it easy to retrieve the details associated with that item.\\r\\nOn the other hand, it is not so easy to sort items by price, sort items by popularity, or search for an item by\\r\\nkeywords in its description. All these features could be implemented with additional data structures. We can\\r\\ncombine multiple data structures together to implement these features. In computer science, we use database\\r\\nsystems (see Chapter 8 Data Management) that work behind the scenes in many applications to manage these\\r\\ndata structures and facilitate long-term storage and access to large amounts of data.\\r\\nJust as calculators have algorithms for calculating numbers, computers have algorithms for computing\\r\\ncomplex data. Data structures represent these complex data, and algorithms act on these data structures.\\r\\n3.2 Algorithm Design and Discovery\\r\\nLearning Objectives\\r\\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\\r\\n\u2022 Understand the approach to solving algorithmic problems\\r\\n\u2022 Explain how algorithm design patterns are used to solve new problems\\r\\n\u2022 Describe how algorithms are analyzed\\r\\nOur introduction to data structures focused primarily on representing complex data. But computer scientists\\r\\nare also interested in designing algorithms for solving a wider variety of problems beyond storing and\\r\\nretrieving data. For example, they may want to plan a route between a start location and an end location on a\\r\\nmap. Although every real-world problem is unique, computer scientists can use a general set of principles to\\r\\ndesign solutions without needing to develop new algorithms from scratch. Just like how many data structures\\r\\ncan represent the same abstract data type, many different solutions exist to solve the same problem.\\r\\nAlgorithmic Problem Solving\\r\\nAn algorithm is a sequence of precise instructions that takes any input and computes the corresponding\\r\\noutput, while algorithmic problem-solving refers to a particular set of approaches and methods for\\r\\ndesigning algorithms that draws on computing\u2019s historical connections to the study of mathematical problem\\r\\nsolving. Early computer scientists were influenced by mathematical formalism and mathematical problem\\r\\nsolving. George P\u00f3lya\u2019s 1945 book, How to Solve It, outlines a process for solving problems that begins with a\\r\\nformal understanding of the problem and ends with a solution to the problem. As an algorithm\\'s input size is\\r\\nalways finite, finding a solution to an algorithmic problem can always be accomplished by exhaustive search.\\r\\nTherefore, the goal of algorithmic problem-solving, as opposed to mathematical problem solving, is to find an\\r\\n\u201cefficient\u201d solution, either in terms of execution time (e.g., number of computer instructions) or space used\\r\\n(e.g., computer memory size). Consequently, the study of algorithmic problem-solving emphasizes the formal\\r\\nproblem or task, with specific input data and output data corresponding to each input. There are many other\\r\\nways to solve problems with computers, but this mathematical approach remains the dominant approach in\\r\\nthe field. Here are a few well-known problems in computer science that we will explore later in this chapter.\\r\\nA data structure problem is a computational problem involving the storage and retrieval of elements for\\r\\nimplementing abstract data types such as lists, sets, maps, and priority queues. These include:\\r\\n\u2022 searching, or the problem of retrieving a target element from a collection of elements\\r\\n100 3 \u2022 Data Structures and Algorithms\\r\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\u2022 sorting, or the problem of rearranging elements into a logical order\\r\\n\u2022 hashing, or the problem of assigning a meaningful integer index for each object\\r\\nA graph problem is a computational problem involving graphs that represent relationships between data.\\r\\nThese include:\\r\\n\u2022 traversal, or the problem of exploring all the vertices in a graph\\r\\n\u2022 minimum spanning tree is the problem of finding a lowest-cost way to connect all the vertices to each\\r\\nother\\r\\n\u2022 shortest path is the problem of finding the lowest-cost way to get from one vertex to another\\r\\nA string problem is a computational problem involving text or information represented as a sequence of\\r\\ncharacters. Examples include:\\r\\n\u2022 matching, or the problem of searching for a text pattern within a document\\r\\n\u2022 compression, or the problem of representing information using less data storage\\r\\n\u2022 cryptography, or the problem of masking or obfuscating text to make it unintelligible\\r\\nModeling\\r\\nComputer scientists focus on defining a problem model, often simply called a model, which is a simplified,\\r\\nabstract representation of more complex real-world problems. They apply the algorithmic problem-solving\\r\\nprocess mentioned previously to design algorithms when defining models. Algorithms model phenom\\nCited Pages: 109, 110, 111']\n",
