He created the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) that operates on top of TCP/IP, the principal protocols used on the Internet.\n",
            "\n",
            "In the early days (Web 1.0), user interaction was limited primarily to reading and selecting web pages. A web page is a document commonly written in HTML and viewed in a browser. This simple request and response paradigm used a client-server model that was easy to implement.\n",
            "\n",
            "## Core Web Technologies\n",
            "\n",
            "Three technologies dominate web programming:\n",
            "1. HTML (hypertext markup language): used to describe the structure and content of web pages\n",
            "2. CSS (cascading style sheets): used to alter the presentation style of the content found in HTML\n",
            "3. JavaScript (JS): a scripting language that adds interactivity to web content and server-side functionality\n",

            "## Web Application Architecture Components\n",
            "\n",
            "### Server-Side Components\n",
            "\n",
            "A web server is a software application that runs at a known URL and responds to HTTP requests. In traditional web applications, the web server performed all the HTML content rendering on the server side, and the client (web browser) would present what it received.\n",
            "\n",
            "As web applications evolved, they needed to maintain state (like shopping cart contents) and handle more complex functionality. This led to the development of more sophisticated architectures.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Model-View-Controller (MVC) Pattern\n",
            "\n",
            "The Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern is a software architectural pattern commonly used in the design of interactive applications, providing a systematic way to organize and structure code. This pattern separates an application into three interconnected components:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. **Model**: Represents the application's data structure and business logic, managing data and rules. It's responsible for data storage and retrieval and has a well-defined API that the Controller uses.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **View**: Responsible for displaying the user interface. It's the presentation layer that handles the user interface.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Controller**: Acts as an intermediary between the model and the view. It performs processing and enforces rules to generate applicable content within a given application domain and separates the user interface from the data.\n",
            "\n",
            "The components in MVC are loosely coupled, meaning they have weak associations with other components. This concept allows for separation of concerns between components, which leads to maintaining high cohesion within websites' functionalities.\n",
            "\n",
            "## Types of Web Applications\n",
            "\n",
            "### Traditional Web Applications\n",
            "\n",
            "In traditional web applications, each user request resulted in a new HTML page being sent from the server to the browser. The Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern was often used for server-side development.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Single-Page Applications (SPAs)\n",
            "\n",
            "Single-page applications (SPAs) load one web page in the browser, manipulating the UI and fetching data through APIs. For the end user, SPAs offered functionality like a traditional desktop application and drastically improved user experience by reducing latency. No longer were expensive web server requests needed that resulted in full page refreshes in the browser.\n",
            "\n",
            "## Responsive Web Design\n",
            "\n",
            "Responsive web applications render effectively in a browser regardless of the user's device screen or orientation. This is important as users increasingly access web applications from various devices with different screen sizes.\n",

            "\n",
            "Web application frameworks have built-in support for architectural patterns that make it easy to extend the framework and use plug-ins to implement commercial-grade websites in a reasonable amount of time. They also support the use of web frameworks that make it possible to build a responsive web application that makes the functionality available on the desktop version of the application seamlessly available on a mobile device.\n",
            "\n",
            "These frameworks help process UI-driven requests that result in publishing or updating web pages. They facilitate the use of HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript to publish responsive web pages that can be rendered by modern browsers on all modern target devices.\n",
