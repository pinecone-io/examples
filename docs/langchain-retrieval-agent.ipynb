        "We've seen in previous chapters how powerful [retrieval augmentation](https://www.pinecone.io/learn/series/langchain/langchain-retrieval-augmentation/) and [conversational agents](https://www.pinecone.io/learn/series/langchain/langchain-agents/) can be. They become even more impressive when we begin using them together.\n",

Algorithms use inputs and a finite number of steps to carry out arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, and produce outputs used in computing. Today's computers still rely on the same foundations of numbers, calculations, and algorithms, except at the scale of billions of numbers and billions of calculations per second.\n",

However, they do not give the\\nbest performance for every single program. Designers have started introducing chips that have excellent\\nperformance, better than multicore, but for a small subset of program types. Examples of these chips are\\ngraphics processing units (GPUs), field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), and tensors processing units\\n(TPUs). The idea is to start the program on a multicore until there is a part where other chips excel. In that\\ncase, the multicore sends that piece of code to the other chips, and this gives rise to parallel programming for\\nheterogeneous systems (i.e., computer systems that have chips with different capabilities). Laptops can now\\nhave a multicore plus GPU.\\nMultiple Nodes\\nHaving multicore plus accelerator chips (e.g., GPUs) on the same board is now the norm and is called a node.\\nBut what about big machines that run in the cloud to give us services such as Amazon, Facebook, and X\\n(formerly Twitter)? These big machines are built using thousands, if not millions, of nodes and they need an\\neven more sophisticated way of programming.\\n5.6 • Processor Architectures 233Chapter Review\\nKey

This special software that translates HLLs to executables includes tools called compilers,\\nassemblers, and linkers. We will not discuss these tools here, (refer to 5.2 Computer Levels of Abstraction and\\n5.4 Machine-Level Program Representation), but we now know what they do. Here, we will look at how the\\nhardware executes instructions.\\nFigure5.3 Programs developed in high-level languages (HLLs) such as C++, Java, or Python are then translated into executables that\\na computer can run. (attribution: Copyright Rice University, OpenStax, under CC BY 4.0 license)\\nHardware Organization of Systems\\nOnce the executable is in the memory, the hardware needs to do several things in order to execute it. Recall\\nthat an executable is a group of instructions in the form of 1s and 0s. The hardware first needs to fetch an\\ninstruction from memory by bringing it from the memory to inside the CPU, which is the brain of the computer\\nthat performs and executes the instructions of a program. Once the instruction is fetched from memory and\\nstored in temporary storage inside the CPU, called a register, the CPU decodes this instruction; that is, it\\ndeciphers or understands the meaning of the several 1s and 0s that constitute the instruction. For example,\\nthe software program may contain an instruction such as “add this number x to the number y and put the\\nresult in z.” Since computers do not understand English, this instruction is stored inside the computer in the\\nform of 1s and 0s. The CPU has to read those 1s and 0s, understand what they mean (i.e., decode it), and then\\nexecute it.\\nAfter the instruction has been decoded, the CPU instructs the arithmetic logic unit (ALU)to execute it. The\\nALU is the piece of hardware inside the CPU that performs computations and logical operations such as\\ncomparisons. Once the instruction is executed, the result is saved into a register or sent back to the memory.\\nThe CPU is now ready to fetch the next instruction. Figure 5.4 shows a computer system’s hardware. Inside the\\nCPU we can see the ALU, a group of registers (called a register file), and a piece of hardware, called the\\nmemory controller, that helps the CPU talk to the memory. Inside the CPU we also find fast storage, which is\\nfaster than the memory but slower than the register, called cache memory. We will discuss cache memory in\\n5.5 Memory Hierarchy.\\n198 5 • Hardware Realizations of Algorithms: Computer Systems Design\\nAccess for free at openstax.orgFigure5.4 Any computer system consists of several components that, together, help the computer do its job of executing programs.\\n(attribution: Copyright Rice University, OpenStax, under CC BY 4.0 license)\\nOne final piece of hardware inside the CPU is the I/O interface. The input/output (I/O)interface helps the CPU\\ntalk to the other I/O devices such as a keyboard or mouse. All the pieces—CPU , memory, graphics card—ar e\\nconnected via a collection of wires referred to as a bus. The purpose of a bus is to transfer data between the\\nvarious pieces in the computer. Buses can differ in speed, which affects how fast the data are transferred.\\nFigure 5.4 uses the generic word interconnect to designate buses. We can add more devices to the computer\\nsystem such as a different display through expansion slots.\\nLINK TO LEARNING\\nRead this concise history of computers starting from the nineteenth century (https://openstax.org/r/\\n76CompHistory19) to see how computers have changed and been developed over time.\\nInput/Output Devices\\nThe job of input/output (I/O) devices is to take input from a user (i.e., typing on a keyboard or speaking into a\\nmicrophone), transform it into 1s and 0s, and store this information in memory. It also takes some 1s and 0s,\\ngenerated by some type of software program, from memory and translates them to an output format such as\\n5.1 • Computer Systems Organization 199a picture on the screen or a sound from a speaker. Distinct devices have different speeds and varying ways of\\ntransforming the input and output to/from 1s and 0s.\\nAny I/O device, your keyboard for example, connects to the computer system using an interface such as a USB\\nport that we see in all computers. The USB controller shown in Figure 5.4 is the piece of hardware that\\nmanages the USB port and allows it to detect that a device has been connected. Another important piece of\\nhardware is the main memory.\\nMain Memory\\nFor the CPU to execute programs and process data stored locally, it needs to obtain them from the computer\\'s\\ndisk. But a disk is very slow. So, the CPU brings what it needs from the disk and temporarily stores it in faster\\nstorage referred to as main memory or random access memory (RAM). When you buy a laptop, one of the\\nspecifications is the amount of memory it has, such as 16 GB of RAM or 32 GB of RAM. The main memory is\\nmuch faster than the disk and connected to the CPU with a faster interconnect, as shown in Figure 5.4. When\\nyou click an icon to start a program (e.g., your web browser), the program and its needed data are copied from\\nthe disk to the main memory. Then, the CPU reads the data and instructions from the memory into the CPU’s\\nregisters and the ALU starts executing it.\\nProcessor\\nThe processor, also called the microprocessor, is another name for the CPU. It is the brain of the computer\\nsystem, and its main job is to execute programs. As we discussed earlier, the processor fetches instructions\\nfrom the memory, understands what each instruction wants to do, gets the data needed to execute the\\ninstruction, executes the instruction, and then stores the result in a register or in the main memory. It keeps\\ndoing so until the program ends. There have been huge advances in processor design leading to faster and\\nmore powerful computers. The processor in your smartphone today is more powerful than a big\\nsupercomputer was a few decades ago.\\n5.2 Computer Levels of Abstraction\\nLearning Objectives\\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\\n• Describe abstraction levels from the highest to the lowest\\n• Explain application programs abstractions in relation to HLLs and instruction set architectures\\n• Discuss processor abstractions and how microarchitecture supports them\\n• Identify the role of the operating system within abstraction\\n• Discuss examples of new disruptive computer systems\\nWhen you look around, you see that complex systems can be viewed as layers of abstractions. The removal of\\nunimportant elements of a program or computer code that distract from its process is called abstraction. This\\nway of looking at complex systems makes it easier to understand them. For example, cars are very\\ncomplicated inventions. At the highest level of abstraction, we look at a car as a set of devices used to operate\\nit such as a steering wheel, brake and accelerator pe\\nCited Pages: 208, 209, 210\\n\\nSnippet 3:\\nsize (WSS) total amount of memory a process requires during a specific period of activity; it is\\nmeasured as the set of pages or data blocks the process accesses\\nSummary\\n6.1What Is an Operating System?\\n• An operating system (OS) is at the core of all of the connected hardware and software.\\n6 • Chapter Review 293• Improving efficiency results in speeding up the implementation of applications from coding time and\\nruntime standpoints. OSs have a large influence because of the abstractions/interfaces they implement.\\n• Operating systems provide both mechanism and policy. Mechanism refers to a set of activities that you\\ncan do. Policy is how to use the mechanism in specific situations.\\n• Virtualization in an operating system allows the system to run different applications that are handled by\\nmultiple users at a time on the same computer.\\n• Server virtualization places a software layer called a hypervisor (e.g., virtual machine monitor or VMM)\\nbetween a machine (e.g., server) hardware and the operating systems that run on it.\\n• Using OS-level or server virtualization allows a server to run different types of operating systems at the\\nsame time on the same computer.\\n• The OS translates from the hardware interface to the application interface and provides each running\\nprogram with its own process.\\n• A process consists of address space, one or more threads of control executing in that address space, and\\nadditional system state associated with it. The thread is a path of execution within a process and a process\\nmay contain multiple threads.\\n• The instruction set architecture (ISA) defines a set of instructions that can be used to write assembly\\nlanguage programs that use the CPU while abstracting the hardware details from the program.\\n• OS functions guarantee protection, isolation, and sharing of resources efficiently via resource allocation\\nand communication.\\n6.2Fundamental OS Concepts\\n• An OS manages computer resources (hardware) and provides services for computer programs (software).\\n• An OS is a complex system and executes many kinds of activities ranging from executing users’ programs,\\nto running background jobs or scripts, to completing system programs.\\n• Processing involves a program, a process, and a processor. An OS is responsible for managing processes,\\nand different OSs approach process management in different ways.\\n• The address space is the set of addresses generated by programs as they reference instructions and data.\\nThe memory space holds the actual main memory locations that are directly addressable for processing.\\n• Computer memory consists of two main types: primary and secondary memory. An OS manages memory\\nspace through memory allocation and memory deallocation as well as by maintaining mappings from\\nvirtual addresses to physical and switching CPU context among addresses spaces.\\n• Device drivers are the routines that interact directly with specific device types and related hardware to\\nindicate how to initialize the device, request I/O, and handle interrupts or errors.\\n• A device register is the interface a device presents to a programmer, whereas each I/O device appears in\\nthe physical address space of the machine as a few words.\\n• In an OS, it is important to have dual mode operations to ensure a high level of security and authority. The\\ndual mode is responsible for separating the user from the kernel mode.\\n• Successful OS designs have had a variety of architectures, such as monolithic, layered, microkernels, and\\nvirtual machine monitors. As the design of an OS—and e ven its role—ar e still evolving, it is simply\\nimpossible today to pick one “correct” way to structure an OS.\\n• A monolithic OS design is an OS architecture where the entire OS is working in kernel space.\\n• A layered OS architecture consists of implementing the OS as a set of layers where each layer exposes an\\nenhanced virtual machine to the layer above.\\n• Hardware abstraction layer (HAL) is an example of layering in modern OSs. It allows an OS to interact with\\na hardware device at a general or abstract level rather than going deep into a detailed hardware level,\\nwhich improves readability.\\n• In a microkernel OS architecture, the functionality and capabilities are added to a minimal core OS.\\n6.3Processes and Concurrency\\n• Concurrent processing is a computing model that improves performance when multiple processors are\\nexecuting instructions simultaneously.\\n294 6 • Chapter Review\\nAccess for free at openstax.org• A process consists of at least an address space, a CPU state, and a set of OS resources.\\n• The OS’s process namespace particulars depend on the specific OS, but in general, the name of a process\\nis called a PID (process ID), which is a set of unique numbers that identify processes.\\n• The OS maintains a data structure to keep track of a process state, which is called the process control\\nblock (PCB) or process descriptor.\\n• Concurrency refers to multiple activities and processes happening at the same time. An OS can achieve\\nconcurrent processing via the use of threads or one of three different processing environments:\\nmultiprogramming, multiprocessing, or distributed processing.\\n• Scheduling is the act of determining which process is in the ready state and should be moved to the\\nrunning state when more resources are requested than can be granted immediately, and in which order\\nthe requests should be serviced.\\n• A good scheduling algorithm minimizes response time, efficiently utilizes resources, and implements\\nfairness by distributing CPU cycles equitably. Four simple scheduling algorithms are FCFS, RR, STCF, and\\nSRPT.\\n• Synchronization is a way of coordinating multiple concurrent activities that use a shared state.\\n• Allocation is a method that defines how data is stored in the memory by providing a set of requests for\\nresources and identifying which processes should be given which resources to make the most efficient use\\nof the resources. There are three main forms of allocation: contiguous allocation, linked allocation, and\\nindexed allocation.\\n6.4Memory Management\\n• The OS loads executable files into memory, allows several different processes to share memory, and\\nprovides facilities for processes to exceed the memory size after they have started running.\\n• Memory multiplexing is dividing the capacity of the communication channel into multiple logical channels.\\n• There are several concepts that are critical to memory multiplexing, namely, isolation, sharing,\\nvirtualization, and utilization.\\n• Time slicing is a time frame for each process to run in a preemptive multitasking CPU such that each\\nprocess will be run every single time slice.\\n• Sharing means that multiple processes can share the same piece of data concurrently.\\n•\\nCited Pages: 303, 304, 305\\n\\nSnippet 4:\\nr own before seeking help or a repair?\\nProcesses vs. Threads\\nAs we have learned, a process is an active program.

A process is an instance of a\\nprogram being executed—or pr ocessed—b y a processor. Thus, processing involves a program, a process, and\\na processor. The processor can be a real processor or a virtual processor (i.e., CPU core assigned to a virtual\\nmachine). At any time, there may be many processes running copies of the same program (e.g., an editor);\\neach process is separate and usually independent. An OS is responsible for managing these processes.\\nDifferent OSs approach process management in different ways. For example, the Windows operating system’s\\napproach consists of adding an operating system call to create a process and other system calls for process\\n252 6 • Infrastructure Abstraction Layer: Operating Systems\\nAccess for free at openstax.orgoperation. The approach used in the UNIX OS is different from this as it consists of splitting the process into\\ntwo steps using fork and exec functionalities. The fork functionality is used to set up privileges by creating a\\ncomplete copy of the process, and the exec functionality brings the executable file into memory to start the\\nexecution.\\nAddress Space and Memory Space Management\\nThe address spaceis the set of addresses generated by programs as they reference instructions and data. The\\nmemory space holds the actual main memory locations that are directly addressable for processing. The OS is\\nresponsible for managing these memory and address spaces (Figure 6.6). To enhance performance,\\ncomputers use virtual memory address space to create the illusion of a large and continuous block of memory\\nfor applications and the operating system to utilize. To do so, the computer’s physical memory is used in\\ncombination with a portion of a hard drive that contains the swap file or page file. Pages containing address\\nspace information for programs are moved in and out of physical memory as necessary to ensure that there is\\nenough physical memory to hold the pages of programs that are running at a given time.\\nFigure6.6 The addresses of the data will be in the address space waiting for the execution to be moved to the memory space.\\n(attribution: Copyright Rice University, OpenStax, under CC BY 4.0 license)\\nComputer memory consists of two main types: primary and secondary memory. The initial point of access for a\\nprocessor that also serves as direct storage for the CPU is called primary memory. To be executed, programs\\nmust reside in primary memory. In multiprocessor systems, primary memory can be classified into three\\narchitectures. The first, uniform memory access (UMA), employs a single memory controller and, thus, access\\ntime to any memory location is the same across all processors. The second, non-uniform memory access\\n(NUMA), is a computer memory design that uses different memory controllers, thus its memory access time\\nvaries depending on the memory’s location relative to a processor. The third, cache-only memory\\narchitecture (COMA), uses multiple interconnected processing nodes, each equipped with a processor (i.e., a\\ncache). This allows for the dynamic allocation of data for optimized access and performance in multiprocessor\\nenvironments.\\nMemory that is used for long-term storage, housing the operating system, applications, and data that need to\\npersist even when the power is off, is called secondary memory. Unlike primary memory, which is volatile and\\nloses data during power interruptions, secondary memory is nonvolatile—meaning it r etains data even during\\npower failures—and thus it pr ovides durability and data retention. Common examples of secondary memory\\ninclude hard disk drives (HDDs) and solid-state drives (SSDs).\\nAn OS must satisfy the policies of how much physical memory to allocate to each process and when to remove\\na process from memory. It must implement these policies using the following mechanisms: memory\\nallocationand memory deallocation. Memory allocation is the process of setting aside sections of memory\\nin a program to be used to store variables and instances of structures and classes. The memory allocation can\\nbe static memory allocation or dynamic memory allocation. Memory deallocation is the process of freeing the\\nspace corresponding to finished processes when that space is needed by the rest of the system. In addition,\\n6.2 • Fundamental OS Concepts 253the OS must maintain mappings from virtual addresses to physical (i.e., page tables) and switch CPU context\\namong address spaces.\\nINDUSTRY SPOTLIGHT\\nWindowing Systems\\nA windowing system is an OS software component that manages the display of graphical user interfaces\\n(GUIs) on a computer screen.

The technologies that we currently\\nuse have the following characteristics:\\n• Technology 1: very fast but expensive, less dense, and volatile\\n• Technology 2: faster and denser, but volatile and moderately expensive\\n• Technology 3: persistent and inexpensive but slow\\n• Technology 4: persistent and very inexpensive but very slow\\nWe need to get the best of all of them, and the best way to combine them must ensure that we have higher\\n222 5 • Hardware Realizations of Algorithms: Computer Systems Design\\nAccess for free at openstax.orgcapacity from technologies 3 and 4 but make technologies 1 and 2 closer to the processor so that they can\\nrespond faster to the processor.

This covers technologies 1 and 2 and, therefore, they are closer to the processor.\\nTechnologies 1 and 2 cover two types of memories that both include random access memory (RAM), which\\nallows the processor to access any part of the memory in any order. Technology 2 is called DRAM, and\\ntechnology 1 is called SRAM. Let us explore each one in turn.\\nMemory: DRAM\\nAs you now know, the memory stores instructions and data, which are presented as 1s and 0s. One type of\\nmemory, dynamic random access memory (DRAM), consists of a large number of capacitors. A capacitoris\\na very small electrical component that stores an electrical charge. A capacitor can be in one of two states:\\neither it holds a charge, in which case we say that a 1 is stored in this capacitor, or it does not hold a charge,\\nwhich means a 0. With millions of capacitors, we can store a large number of 1s and 0s. This is what you find in\\nthe specs of your laptop; when you say that you have 32GB of RAM, it means there are about 32 billion bytes in\\nmemory. Each byte consists of 8 bits. Each bit requires a capacitor.\\nCapacitors have a not-so-great characteristic though. When a charge is left on a capacitor for some time, the\\ncapacitor starts discharging and loses its charge. This means we lose the data stored in memory. Because of\\nthis, there is circuitry built inside the DRAM that, every few milliseconds, checks the capacitors and adds a\\ncharge to them. We call this the refresh cycle. It is done dynamically, hence the name dynamic RAM or DRAM.\\nThe capacitors are not standalone by themselves. Transistors are used with them to help organize those\\ncapacitors into rows (also called word lines) and columns (also called bit lines) for addressing specific bits.\\nFigure 5.21 shows a simplified view of DRAM. The cell, which stores 1 bit, is made up of the capacitor and some\\ntransistors.\\n224 5 • Hardware Realizations of Algorithms: Computer Systems Design\\nAccess for free at openstax.orgFigure5.21 This simplified view of DRAM shows one bank. (attribution: Copyright Rice University, OpenStax, under CC BY 4.0 license)\\nWhat is shown in Figure 5.21 is called a bank. Every few banks form a chip. Every few chips form a rank. A small\\nmemory board that contains several memory banks is a dual in-line memory module (DIMM). Several DIMMs\\nform a channel. This organization is shown in Figure 5.22. The reason for having this organization is twofold.\\nFirst, if we have one huge 2-D array of memory cells, it is too complex, slow, and power hungry, so dividing it\\ninto parts makes those parts simpler and that means faster and less power hungry. Second, if there are several\\nmemory addresses that need to be accessed and they fall into different banks, for example, the memory can\\nrespond in parallel.\\nFigure5.22 DRAM memory banks can be organized into chips, ranks, DIMMs, and channels. (credit: modification of \"168 pin and 184\\npin DIMM memory modules\" by Veeblefetzer/Wikimedia Commons, CC BY 4.0)\\nYou must have heard the term 64-bit machines, right? Most of our computer systems nowadays are 64 bit. One\\nof the definitions of this term is that the connection between the processor and the memory has 64-bit width;\\nits memory can send the data to, or receive data from, the processor in chunks of 64 bits.\\nThe curve that we saw in Figure 5.19 shows the slow speed increase of the DRAM, which affects the\\nperformance of the overall system. If the processor must go to the memory for every instruction and every\\n5.5 • Memory Hierarchy 225piece of data, the overall system performance is very low; therefore, computer designers speed things up by\\nusing a faster technology together with the DRAM. This faster technology, technology 1 in Figure 5.20 is called\\nthe SRAM.\\nMemory: SRAM\\nThere are several\\nCited Pages: 232, 233, 234, 235, 236\\n\\nSnippet 7:\\n that use various artificial intelligence computing approaches.\\nFor example, artificial intelligence algorithms can accurately determine the intentions of the wearer and\\ncontrol a prosthetic’s motion in an accurate and natural way. Internet connectivity means devices can be\\nconveniently controlled by applications, relay telemetry to healthcare providers, and automatically apply over-\\nthe-air updates. TechWorks has fitted a small, inexpensive, energy-efficient system-on-chip computer to their\\ndevices, and are using the middle-level language C to implement these features efficiently.\\n4.1 Models of Computation\\nLearning Objectives\\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\\n• Define low-level programming languages, including assembly language\\n• Define middle-level and high-level programming languages, such as C and JavaScript\\n• Compare and contrast the various programming paradigms\\nAlgorithms are used to solve computational problems and create computational models. A computational\\nmodelis a system that defines what an algorithm does and how to run it. Examples of such computational\\nmodels include physical devices that can run software, programming languages, or a design specification of\\nsuch. A programming language is a linguistic application of an algorithm, which uses computational models\\nfocused on defining notations for writing code.\\nMany computational models have been devised for a host of other applications. There are many different roles\\nand perspectives within the worlds of computer science and software development. The end goal of software\\ndevelopment is to create working software that can run on a hardware model, which itself uses a (hardware)\\nrealization of an algorithm that enables specific physical computers to execute software programs. A hardware\\nmodel is designed for the convenience of a machine, not a human software author, so hardware models are\\npoorly suited to writing code. Computer scientists have created programming languages which are designed\\nspecifically for programmers to develop practical applications. These languages are usually classified into high-\\nlevel (Java, Python) and low-level languages (assembly language). A high-level programming language\\noperates at a high level of abstraction, meaning that low-level details such as the management of memory are\\nautomated. In contrast, a low-level programming languageoperates at a low level of abstraction. Languages\\nlike C and C++ can perform both high-level and low-level tasks.\\nMost software is designed, written, and discussed in terms of how a program should work. It is basically a\\nseries of steps that provide a direction of how the program must be executed. An example of this would be the\\n“Map Reduce model” which is used in distributed systems like the Google search engine to produce search\\nresults for large data sets using a complex algorithm. Moving even further away from hardware models,\\ncomputer scientists have also defined an abstract model, which is a technique that derives simpler high-level\\nconceptual models for a computer while exploring the science of what new algorithms can or cannot do.\\nModern computers are equipped with a central processor, referred to as a central processing unit (CPU),\\nwhich is a computer chip capable of executing programs. A CPU’s hardware model relies on a specific CPU\\ninstruction set architecture (ISA)that defines a list of operations that the CPU can execute, such as storing\\nthe results of calculations (Figure 4.2). With the advancements of technology, computer engineers have\\ndesigned computer architectures with increasing sophistication and power. Examples of hardware models\\ninclude the MOS Technology 6502 architecture used by the Nintendo Entertainment System, the ARM\\narchitecture used by mobile phones, and the x86-64 and AMD64 architectures used by modern personal\\ncomputers. Computer engineers design architectures with hardware specifications, such as execution speed or\\nenergy use, in mind. Therefore, hardware models are not suitable for humans to use for communicating\\n146 4 • Linguistic Realization of Algorithms: Low-Level Programming Languages\\nAccess for free at openstax.orgalgorithms.\\nFigure4.2 A standard CPU model shows how a program logic applies low-level instructions to an input to get an output; the program\\nleverages registers and memory (black arrows) and the CPU orchestrates the overall execution of the program (red arrows).\\n(attribution: Copyright Rice University, OpenStax, under CC BY 4.0 license)\\nA programming modelis designed for humans to read and write. A programming model focused on defining\\na notation for writing code can also be called a programming language. A programming model can be used to\\nimplement a software algorithm using a strict set of syntactical rules. A language’s syntax can define keywords\\nsuch as “if.” The syntax may include a mathematical operator, a fundamental programming operation that\\ncombines values, such as “+.” The syntax can define punctuation such as “;”. Essentially, the syntax gives the\\nprecise meaning for what each of these elements directs a computer to do. The text of a program written in a\\nprogramming language is called source code. Software engineers have created practically all software by\\nwriting source code in various programming languages. Since a programming model cannot directly execute a\\nprogram, a compileror interpretermust translate source code from a middle-level or high-level language\\ninto something a computer can execute.\\nAs mentioned, abstract models are computational models used to think about algorithms in the abstract,\\nrather than being used to create and run software. The goal of an abstract model is to make it easy for people\\nto devise and convey algorithms. Computer scientists use abstract models to create new algorithms, analyze\\nthe efficiency of algorithms, and prove facts about what algorithms can and cannot do. An abstract model is\\nnot concerned with the details of computer architectures, which makes it easier to focus on these sorts of\\ndeep questions. Examples of abstract models include the Random Access Machine, the Turing machine, and\\nthe Lambda calculus. The Random Access Machine(Figure 4.3) is a CPU that consists of unlimited memory\\ncells that can store any arbitrary value. Just like any other CPU, the PC determines the statement to be\\nexecuted next. A Random Access Machine can be used to analyze the efficiency of algorithms. A Turing\\nmachine (Figure 4.4) is a mathematical model that can implement any algorithm. The Lambda calculusis a\\ntheoretical computation concept using lambda functions. It was defined by Alonzo Church and inspired the\\nfunctional programming paradigm, which you will learn more about in Programming Language Paradigms.\\n4.1 • Models of Computation 147\\nCited Pages: 156, 157\\n\\nSnippet 8:\\nqueue is the first\\none to be removed);

Why do you think world class programmers are very\\nwell versed in assembly? Professional programmers write in HLL but they often like to look at the assembly\\nversion of their code as well. This allows them to discover mistakes in their HLL code and also to find out\\nways to enhance their HLL code.\\nHowever, there are some programs, or parts of programs, that need to be written in assembly and not in\\n218 5 • Hardware Realizations of Algorithms: Computer Systems Design\\nAccess for free at openstax.orgHLL for the sake of performance (assembly code written by a human in these cases is much faster than HLL\\ntranslated to assembly by a compiler) and more control over the hardware. Assembly language common\\nuses today include device drivers, low-level embedded systems, and real-time systems.\\nOperands\\nAn assembly language program consists of a group of instructions. Each instruction does an operation and for\\nthis operation to be executed, it needs operands. An operandis a value used as input for an operator. Perhaps\\nwe want to add two numbers in an operation. To be executed it needs two numbers, which are the operands.\\nFor example: add %RAX, %RBX means add the content of the register RAX to the content of the register RBX\\nand put the result in register RAX. Operands in assembly can be one of three things:\\n• A register\\n• An immediate operand (e.g., add 7 to rax; the operand here is mentioned explicitly in the instruction)\\n• Data from memory\\nMemory Addressing Modes\\nTo get data from the memory, we need to specify the location, called the addressing mode, in the memory\\nthat contains the required data. Why are there several “modes” instead of just specifying an address directly?\\nWell, the answer is related to the HLL.\\nIn HLL programs, we use complicated data structures, such as arrays with one or more dimensions, structures,\\nor linked lists. The compiler needs to translate this data structure to a much simpler assembly language. In\\nassembly there are no complex data structures; there are only data items of 1, 2, 4, and 8 bytes. Then how can\\nwe map these complex data structures to the simple single dimension data items? One crucial way is to have\\nrich addressing modes. In its most general form, an address in x86 is specified as D (Rb, Ri, S) where:\\n• D is a non-negative (but can be 0) integer whose range is from 0 to 232 – 1.\\n• Rb and Ri are registers, and they can be any one of the 16 registers.\\n• S is a scale that takes one of the following values: 1, 2, 4, or 8.\\nThe address is calculated as: D + Rb + (S × Ri). While this is a general form, it can have more reduced forms\\nsuch as (Rb, Ri). Here D’s default is 0 and S’s default is 1; D (Rb, Ri); or (Rb, Ri, S).\\nNow that we know about operands, let’s look at the operations themselves that are implemented by the\\ndifferent assembly instructions.\\nLINK TO LEARNING\\nIt is always good to see the concepts we learn in action. Visit this site to write an HLL program and see the\\ncorresponding assembly (https://openstax.org/r/76HLLProgram) at the same time. Any change you make to\\nthe HLL code will have an effect on the assembly.\\nAssembly Operations\\nIn any ISA, all assembly instructions fall into one of three categories:\\n1. Data movement: from register to register, from memory to register, and from register to memory\\n2. Arithmetic and logic operations including addition, subtraction, AND, OR, and so on\\n3. Control instructions, which are the instructions that implement the “go to” operations, whether\\nconditional or non-conditional (category also includes procedure calls)\\n5.4 • Machine-Level Program Representation 219Data Movement Operations\\nThe data movement in assembly takes the form movx source or destination where:\\n• “x” specifies the number of bytes to be moved from source to destination. It can take one of the following\\nvalues: “b” means 1 byte, “w” (word) means 2 bytes, “l” (long) means 4 bytes, and “q” (quad word) means 8\\nbytes. If you think about it, these are the sizes of all the data types we have in any HLL.\\n• the source and destination can be any of the operand types we mentioned earlier. There are only three\\ncombinations that are not allowed. The first is to move immediate to immediate as it does not make sense.\\nThe second is to move from memory to memory because the CPU must be involved. The last prohibited\\ncombination is when the destination is immediate as it also does not make any sense. Some examples:\\n◦ “movq %rax, %rbx”\\nMove 8 bytes from register rax and put them in register rbx, which is not really a move; it is a copy.\\n◦ “movq (%rax, %rbx, 4), %rcx”\\nThis is a bit complicated. It involves three steps: first, calculate [rax + (4 × rbx)]; second, use this\\ncalculated value as an address and go to the memory at that address; and third, get 8 bytes, starting\\nfrom the address you calculated (do not forget the “q” at the end of the mov instruction) and put them\\nin register rcx. Now do you see why x86 is CISC where C means complex?\\nArithmetic and Logic Operations\\nThe arithmetic and logic operations involve very well-known operations such as add, subtract, multiply, and or,\\nxor, shift left, and shift right. As you may have guessed, these are operations that require two operands. Look\\nat the type of operands that we investigated earlier. For example:\\naddq %rax, %rbx\\nmeans rax = rax + rbx.\\nAdditionally, there are some one operand operations such as increment and decrement. There are some\\ncomplexities involved in multiplication and division where there are different instructions for signed and\\nunsigned integers. And, for the division, yet another complexity is where to store the remainder.\\nComparison and Test Operations\\nTo be able to implement the complex data flow in HLLs (e.g., switch case or if-else), the assembly language\\nmust support conditional and unconditional go to. In x86 parlance, it is called a jump instruction. The generic\\nform of jump is the jump instruction followed by a label. The labelis a variable name that we give to an\\nassembly instruction. This is needed because if you want to say (go to this instruction), how can you define\\n“this” instruction? The label takes the following form: label: instruction. For example:\\npart: movq %rax, %rbx\\n. . . .\\njmp part\\nIn this example, “part” is the label for the move instruction. The “j\\nCited Pages: 228, 229, 230\\n\\nSnippet 10:\\n 1. In the\\nprogrammer’s view of the assembly program, there are some flags that give information on the previous\\ninstruction (refer to Figure 5.18). One of the flags is called the zero flag, and it is set to 1 if the previous\\ninstruction has generated 0 as a result. For example, subtracting two registers and getting the result of 0.\\nProcedure Call Operations\\nOne last item is related to procedure call—x86 has two instructions: CALL and RET to implement. Ho wever, the\\n220 5 • Hardware Realizations of Algorithms: Computer Systems Design\\nAccess for free at openstax.orgsituation is more complicated than this. In HLLs, you have the concept of local variables and global variables.\\nHow is this enforced in assembly? Remember, the assembly program generated must behave in the same way\\nyou intended when you wrote the HLL program.\\nAssembly uses the concept of a stack, the very well-known data structure that works as last-in-first-out, to\\nsimulate the notion of local variables, passing arguments to procedure, and saving some of the registers in\\nmemory during a procedure call. Why do we need to save some registers? Because we have only 16 registers\\nin x86, and programmers use way more variables than that in their HLL.\\nVector Instructions\\nYou may have realized that we have not mentioned floating points at all in the x86 operations. This is because\\nthere is another set of instructions and another set of registers for floating points—the vector instructions.\\nThese instructions operate not on individual registers, but on a vector (i.e., a group of numbers). So, an\\naddition operation can add 32 numbers to another 32 numbers at once. That is, the first number is added to\\nthe corresponding first number in the second vector, the second number to second number, and so forth.\\nThese operations are usually very efficient in many applications.\\n5.5 Memory Hierarchy\\nLearning Objectives\\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\\n• Discuss various memory and storage tools\\n• Differentiate between various types of storage technologies\\n• Explain how locality is used to optimize programs\\nFor the processor to do its job, which is doing the calculations, it must be fed instructions and data. This means\\nthe overall performance depends on both the calculation’s speed and the speed by which data and instructions\\nare received. No matter how fast your processor is, you do not get good performance if the stream of\\ninstructions and data is not fast enough. Everything worked well in the early days of computing, from the\\n1940s until the early 1990s, and then computing hit a wall—a memory wall.\\nResearchers in industry and academia achieved good leaps in performance for processors by innovating ways\\nto use transistors provided to them by Moore’s law. They used those transistors, which were doubling per chip\\non average every 18 months, to add more features to the processor leading to better processor performance.\\nHowever, the same was not done with memory, which resulted in a speed up gap between memory and\\nprocessor. The gap started small and then got wider until it became a bottleneck of performance. Figure 5.19\\nshows the trend in the processor-memory performance gap.\\nFigure5.19 The gap between processor speed and memory speed is increasing. (attribution: Copyright Rice University, OpenStax,\\n5.5 • Memory Hierarchy 221under CC BY 4.0 license)\\nIn this section, we explore memory technology. We will discuss the different technologies by which memory is\\nbuilt, explain what we mean by memory hierarchy, and see what researchers have done to deal with the\\nprocessor-memory gap.\\nMemory and Storage\\nWhat is our wish list for the perfect memory? Probably speed—we want a fast memory . But be\\ncareful—memory speed is differ ent from memory capacity. Memory capacity has increased throughout the\\nyears at a much faster rate than memory speed. We also want infinite capacity and persistence; that is, when\\nthe power is off, we want the memory to keep its content.\\nNext, we want to be able to pack a large amount of storage in as small an area as possible via density, which\\ncomes in handy especially for portable devices such as your smartwatch or smartphone. And what about the\\ncost? If the memory is very expensive, the whole computer system is very expensive which means that nobody\\nbuys it; designers then have to put a smaller memory size into the computer system to keep the price low. But\\nsmaller memory means less functionality to the computer system and lower overall performance.\\nThe reality is much less ideal. There is no single technology that excels in all these aspects. Some technologies\\nare fast but more expensive, volatile, and less dense, while others are cheap and persistent but are relatively\\nslower than other technologies. If we pick only one technology, we end up with a non-functional system. For\\nexample, if we pick the fast and volatile but expensive technology, the resulting computing system, which is\\nprobably very expensive, needs to be powered on indefinitely in order to retain the data.

This global perspective can be particularly useful\\nwhen considering how IT and OSs affect health care.

The\\nchallenges associated with data sharing, privacy, and health-care disparities impact regions around the\\nworld differently.\\nAs the delivery of health care becomes more integrated with technology, the choices made in designing\\nhow health-care IT systems use OSs can significantly impact people’s lives across the globe. These choices\\nrange from deciding how to take ethical considerations into account when using AI for diagnosis to creating\\nIT solutions that respect cultural differences.\\nCheck out these initiatives from the World Health Organization (https://openstax.org/r/76WHO) and\\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention (https://openstax.org/r/76CDC) for examples in the health-care\\nindustry.\\nImagine you’re considering entering the health-care IT field. Can you think of some ways that thinking\\nglobally and understanding the capabilities provided by OSs could improve your ability to solve problems\\nand create solutions that work well for health-care systems in various countries?\\nHardware Management\\nThe ISA defines how the CPU is controlled by the software by abstracting the hardware details from the\\napplications. The OS provides an abstract machine interface to the application programs and leverages the\\nphysical machine interface to do so. The OS communicates with input/output (I/O) hardware using device\\ndrivers, I/O ports, interrupts, direct memory access (DMA), and effective I/O scheduling. It provides\\nabstractions to manipulate files (i.e., streams) and send messages to the network (i.e., sockets). Programming\\nlanguages provide application programming interfaces (APIs) that leverage these abstractions (e.g., file I/O,\\nsocket libraries, and related APIs) so that the application program can access the underlying resources that are\\nmanaged by the OS. One of the main responsibilities of the OS is to isolate hardware from programs by\\nproviding common services and background management functionality, for example, storage manager,\\nnetwork manager, and power manager.\\nThe OS is the only system that should be able to directly access I/O devices (i.e., disks, network cards) and\\nmanipulate memory. Moreover, the CPU hardware provides a privileged instructionthat can only be executed\\nby the OS. The OS can use these instructions to establish an execution environment that limits access (to, for\\nexample, memory). The application cannot remove the restrictions because it must execute privileged\\ninstructions to do so.\\nCertain operations are prohibited when running in user mode, such as changing the page table pointer (i.e.,\\nthe pointers to memory pages that are cached for faster access), disabling interrupts (i.e., the interrupts that\\nthe OS received from I/O devices), interacting directly with hardware, and writing to kernel memory. Carefully\\ncontrolled transitions between user mode and kernel mode include system calls, interrupts, and exceptions.\\nThe system callappears when the program requests a service from the kernel. The system interrupt\\nmanages the communication between the computer hardware and the system. The system throws an\\nexception, which is an error that occurs at runtime.\\nTHINK IT THROUGH\\nThe Ethics of Open-Source OSs\\nThe idea of making all operating systems open-source (i.e., the copyright holder releases the content or\\nproduct under a license that allows any user to access, modify, and distribute it freely) has both advantages\\nand disadvantages. On the plus side, open-source operating systems can be more secure and innovative\\n6.1 • What Is an Operating System? 249because anyone can inspect and improve the code. This openness also encourages a global community of\\ndevelopers to collaborate, potentially leading to a technology that is more user-friendly and accessible for\\neveryone. Additionally, openness aligns with ethical principles of transparency and freedom, as it allows\\nusers to understand and control their digital environments fully.\\nThere are, however, downsides too. Open-source projects might struggle to secure consistent funding and\\nprofessional support, which can lead to them having slower updates and fixes compared to commercial\\nsoftware. There’s also the risk of fragmentation, where too many variations of the system can create\\ncompatibility issues and confuse users.\\nFrom an ethical standpoint, the use of open-source operating systems globally can democratize access to\\ntechnology, ensuring that no single company has too much control over our digital lives. It also encourages\\na culture of sharing and collaboration, which is essential for addressing global challenges like digital divide\\nand ensuring equitable access to technology. However, the success of such a model depends on balancing\\nopenness with the need for sustainable development and support systems to keep the technology reliable\\nand up to date.\\nShould operating systems all be open source? Discuss pros and cons.\\nProtected Sharing\\nAn OS’s functions should guarantee protection, isolation, and the sharing of resources efficiently via resource\\nallocation and communication. To implement protected sharing, the OS provides common services (e.g.,\\nsharing and authorization). There are many ways to leverage OS sharing.

They just differ as it comes to how powerful each piece\\nis, how many CPUs are there, the size of the memory and disk, and so on.\\n5.2Computer Levels of Abstraction\\n• The levels from problem definition to assembly language are related to the computer science field. People\\nstudying computer science explore how to solve a problem using an algorithm, how to translate this\\n5 • Chapter Review 235algorithm into a programming language, then how to translate this programming language into a\\nlanguage that computers can understand.\\n• Computer processors operate at various levels of abstraction going from the digital logic level up to the\\nmicroarchitecture level and the machine language level. The highest level of abstraction for application\\nprograms is that obtained by writing programs in a high-level language. Using a compiler makes it\\npossible to generate a representation of such programs at a lower level of abstraction known as assembly\\nlanguage. That representation uses instructions that are part of the instruction set architectures (ISA)\\nspecific to the processor family in use.\\n• The operating system (OS) is the only piece of software that can directly access the hardware of a\\ncomputer. All other programs must interface with the OS to have it achieve a specific task in a secure\\nfashion by scheduling the corresponding process. The OS stores data and programs on disk in an\\norganized way, using a file system, and allocates memory to programs.\\n• Upcoming computer designs call for new computing abstractions that will deviate from the traditional\\nbinary logic. For example, quantum computing uses qubits and neuromorphic computing uses hardware\\nneurons.\\n5.3Machine-Level Information Representation\\n• The most frequently used data items are stored inside a computer.\\n• An integer is a number that does not have a floating point; 7 is an integer but 3.14 is not. Integers are\\ndivided into two categories: signed and unsigned. Signed integers can be positive, negative, or 0.\\nUnsigned integers are 0 or positive; therefore, they do not need a sign because they will never be\\nnegative. This is why we call them unsigned.\\n• Real numbers, known as floating point numbers, are the numbers that represent fractions. Integers\\ncannot represent numbers like 3.14 or –1.25. This is the role of floating point numbers.\\n• Characters and symbols on your keyboard are represented inside the computer as 1s and 0s. Every\\ncharacter has its own code.\\n• The range of numbers that n-bit binary number can present if interpreted as a signed or an unsigned\\ninteger is helpful to you when you write a program because if you know the values that a variable in your\\nprogram may take, you can make a precise decision about the type of that variable when you declare it.\\n5.4Machine-Level Program Representation\\n• An x86-64 Intel processor uses a complex instruction set computer architecture (CISC).

This makes us revisit the concept of compilers. A compiler takes as input a\\nprogram written in an HLL, and we have a compiler for each HLL. The output of the compiler is an assembly\\nprogram in a specific ISA, and we have a compiler for each different ISA (e.g., ISA 1 and ISA 2).

Before we\\ndiscuss hardware, we need to understand two words: translator and interpreter. Both words mean “translating\\nfrom language 1 to language 2” regardless of what those languages are. The main difference is the process by\\nwhich translation is done. A translator takes a whole program in language 1 and generates another program\\nin language 2. For example, the compiler takes an HLL as input (language 1) and generates the corresponding\\nassembly language program (language 2). The interpreter takes one line (or command) in the program in\\nlanguage 1 and generates one (or more) instructions in language 2. Python is a popular example of an\\ninterpreted language.\\nUnderstanding the hardware level allows us to see how computers execute programs. The main part of the\\ncomputer hardware that does the execution is called the processor. The processor takes one instruction from\\nthe machine language file, executes it, and writes the results back in a designated place. Then, it fetches the\\nfollowing instruction and does the same. It keeps doing this until the program ends or an error occurs. This is\\nan oversimplification, but it conveys the general idea. As you can see, it takes one instruction at a time, which\\nis why the vertical arrow coming out of the machine language box in Figure 5.5 shows the word interpreter.\\nBut how does the processor do its job of fetching an instruction and executing it? To answer this question, we\\nneed to look at the main components of a processor.\\nLINK TO LEARNING\\nThe transistor is the building block of the hardware of any computer. A transistor is merely an on/off switch;\\nwhen it is on, it lets the electrical current pass. When it is off, it blocks the electrical current. This is very\\nsimilar to the light switch you find in your room. But with these transistors, we can do more: with\\ntransistors, we build computers. Read this article to learn more about transistors (https://openstax.org/r/\\n76Transistors) and how they work.\\nMicroarchitecture\\nThe architecture (i.e., design) of the microprocessor (i.e., the processor) is called microarchitecture(Figure\\n5.9). Its main job is to design the different components of the processor and decide how to connect them so\\nthat the processor can do its job. For example, one important piece inside the processor is the part that\\nfetches the next instruction of the program. Another crucial part, called the control unit, is responsible for\\ndecoding, or understanding, what this instruction wants to do and then tells the other components of the\\nprocessor to execute this instruction. So, the control unit’s job is to take an instruction as input and generate\\nsignals to control the rest of the processor to make it execute the instructions. Other parts of the processor\\ninclude the execution units that do the actual computations such as divide, multiply, add, and subtract.\\n5.2 • Computer Levels of Abstraction 205Figure5.9 Although it may just take seconds to execute, there are several steps included in a microarchitecture process to deliver\\nresults for the user. (attribution: Copyright Rice University, OpenStax, under CC BY 4.0 license)\\nTo summarize, inside the processor you find those different pieces that fetch instructions, decode them, and\\nexecute them. But what is inside each one of these black boxes?\\nDigital Logic Abstraction\\nThe main building block that forms the processor is called a logic gate. There are very few logic gate types:\\nAND, OR, NOT, NAND, NOR, XOR, and XNOR. Using these gates, and most of the time only a subset of them,\\nyou can design all the pieces that form the processor discussed earlier. But what is inside these gates? How are\\nthey built?\\nThe Lowest Level of Abstraction\\nThe main building block of all logic gates, and hence of all processors, is the transistor. This is shown at the\\nbottom of Figure 5.5 as device level. Though you may have heard the word transistor before, you may not\\nknow exactly what it does. Simply speaking, a transistor is an on and off switch. This is very similar to the light\\nswitch in your house that can turn a light on or off. A transistorlets an electrical current pass, the ON state, or\\ncan block the electrical current, the OFF state. Transistors are turned ON/OFF based on the voltage input to the\\ntransistor. If the voltage is higher than a threshold, the transistor is in the ON state. Otherwise, it is in the OFF\\nstate. There are only two states: ON/OFF, which correspond to 1 and 0. This is why computers understand only\\n1s and 0s. By interconnecting several transistors in some way, we build an AND gate. If we connect them in a\\ndifferent way, we build an OR gate, and so on.\\nIf we try to see how transistors are built and work, then we move to the semiconductor level. At this level we\\nuse a special material such as silicon and a special, and very expensive, process to turn it into a working\\ntransistor. A single processor contains billions of transistors. How can a material like silicon make a transistor?\\nThis takes us to the level of atoms and quantum physics.\\nThe Role of the Operating System\\nNow that we have rundown the problem definition to quantum physics, you may wonder where the operating\\nsystem (OS) (i.e., OS X, Windows, Linux) fits in this bigger scheme. The OS is similar to any application program\\nin the sense that it has to be written in an HLL, typically C/C++, and passed through the compiler and\\nassembler to generate machine code.

Most\\nlikely not, except in rare cases where you are developing some part of an operating system, a device driver, or\\nany other application that requires very low-level manipulation. However, by looking at the assembly language\\ngenerated by the compiler for your code, you can find innovative ways to optimize your code, detect hidden\\nbugs, and reason about the performance of your code once you execute it.\\nIntel Processors and Related Architectures\\nYou may recall that each processor family understands a set of instructions, which is the ISA. The family of\\nprocessors from Intel and AMD share the same ISA called x86 (x86-64 for the relatively newer version for later\\nprocessors). This ISA has a long history that dates back to the 1970s. Figure 5.16 gives a quick glimpse at how\\nthings evolved. The figure does not show every single processor from Intel but instead focuses on some\\nmilestones.\\n214 5 • Hardware Realizations of Algorithms: Computer Systems Design\\nAccess for free at openstax.orgFigure5.16 x86 is a CISC ISA with backward compatibility dating back to the 70s. (attribution: Copyright Rice University, OpenStax,\\nunder CC BY 4.0 license)\\nFirst, as technology evolves and the need for faster processing power arises, we move from 16, to 32, to 64-bit\\nprocessors. This number relates to the size of the registers (fast storage entities inside the processor), the\\nwidth of the buses (parallel wires connecting the processor to memory), and the amount of memory the\\nprocessor can access (for n-bit machines, the processor can access 2n bytes of memory). The ISA also evolves\\nin parallel to incorporate the larger registers (hence the move from IA32 to x86-64) and the computations with\\nlarger numbers. Second, we can see the tremendous increase in transistors in each generation. Having more\\ntransistors means more features implemented inside the processor and hence higher performance and\\npotentially richer ISA.\\nThe complex architecture structure that assists in executing operations such as mathematical computations\\nand memory storage is called complex instruction set computer (CISC). This is done by combining many\\nsimple instructions into a single complex one. This concept came from something called the semantic gap,\\nwhich is the difference between the HLL program and its assembly equivalent. It is good for programmers to\\nunderstand assembly language as this skill will help you code in any language. However, assembly\\nprogramming is so much different from HLL programming that most programmers have difficulty\\nunderstanding it. The wider the difference, the wider the semantic gap. To reduce this gap and make assembly\\nlanguage more accessible to programmers, x86 was designed to make its instructions a bit more complicated\\nbecause statements in HLL are complicated. Complicated means a single assembly instruction can do several\\nthings. For example, an instruction like addw %rax, (%rbx) means access the memory at a specific address, get\\nthe data stored there, add that data to a number, and store that number in a specific place. So, it is accessing\\nthe memory, making an addition, and storing the result somewhere. Because the instructions are complicated,\\nthis set of these instructions is called CISC.\\nComplex instructions such as the ones corresponding to a for-loop in HLL were the norm until the 1980s when\\nanother viewpoint came into existence that said that complex instructions make the processor slow. Moving\\ninto the 1990s, and the appearance of portable devices with their sensitivity to power consumption and\\nbattery life, another disadvantage of CISC arose: complex instructions make the processor not only slow, but\\nalso power hungry. And, thus, the other viewpoint of simpler instructions called reduced instruction set\\ncomputer (RISC)came to be the norm. Right now, all the processor families in the world are RISC except x86.\\n5.4 • Machine-Level Program Representation 215LINK TO LEARNING\\nThere has been a debate among companies who are designing hardware as to whether CISC or RISC is\\nbetter. Read this article chronicling this debate (https://openstax.org/r/76DebCISCvsRISC) from\\nMicrocontrollerTips.\\nAssembly and Machine Code\\nIn our discussion of Figure 4.18 we saw assembly (output of the compiler) and object code, binary code, and\\nmachine code, which all designate output of the assembler. Machine code is the binary presentation of the\\nassembly code. In some cases, there are assembly instructions that do not have a counterpart in the machine\\ncode called pseudo-assembly. For example, there are instructions in assembly that execute a go to if a\\nnumber is less than another number. The only conditions known in machine code are equal and not equal, but\\nnot less than, less or equal, and so on. We can see this in an instruction set like MIPS.\\nThe assembler’s job is to ensure that the machine code file only contains instructions that are native to the\\nprocessor; that is, part of the ISA. So, we can think of the machine code as being a subset of the assembly\\ncode. You never find an instruction in the machine code file that is not part of the ISA of the processor for\\nwhich you want to generate the binary. The reason there are pseudo-assembly instructions is to give the\\ncompiler a bit more freedom to generate efficient code. Let us assume that you write a program in C and you\\nthink about functions calling each other. If you write a program in C++ or Java, you think in terms of objects,\\nmethods, inheritance, and so on (refer to Chapter 4 Linguistic Realization of Algorithms: Low-Level\\nProgramming Languages). We call this the programmer view of the language. What if you write (or read)\\nassembly code? What do you see? This view is summarized in Figure 5.17.\\nFigure5.17 The assembly programmer sees a simpler, but more realistic view of the machine than the HLL programmer.

When you access the memory,\\nyou may want to get data and must provide an address. Or you may want to write data to memory, so you\\nmust provide both the data and the address to which this data will be written. In both cases, the CPU must\\nprovide an address, therefore, the address bus is single directional. But the data bus is bidirectional\\nbecause you can send data to memory or get data from memory.\\n• Data is not the only thing you need to bring from the memory to the CPU. The main job of the CPU is to\\nexecute instructions on data.

There are advantages and disadvantages to interpreting and compiling methods, which\\nwe will cover in Implementation Approaches.\\nThe most popular scripting languages employ C-like syntax, but they are purposed for different applications.\\nFor example, the JavaScript and PHP scripting languages are purposed for programming web applications.\\nCONCEPTS IN PRACTICE\\nHLLs and Web Applications\\nMost HLLs that are used to develop web applications are scripting languages. These include JavaScript, PHP,\\nASP.NET, and Python. JavaScript is nearly universal for front-end (browser, client-side) applications. Web\\nservers such as the Apache web server and Microsoft’s Internet Information Services (IIS) server support a\\nCommon Gateway Interface (CGI) that allows the invocation of server-side programs including scripts.\\nSome of these scripting languages are now bolstered by web frameworks that are designed to support the\\ndevelopment of applications in the particular languages. For example, the most popular framework for web\\napplications today in JavaScript is React. The most popular one for Python is Django. A guide to web\\nframeworks (https://openstax.org/r/76WebFrameworks) may be found at the Statista website.\\nC#\\nIn 2000, Microsoft announced C# would be its flagship language. It also has the same fundamental syntax as\\nC++ and Java. However, it is purposed to support Windows applications by closely tying in with Microsoft’s net\\nframework, but it can also be used on Linux and macOS. Net C# is a multi-language, component-based\\nsoftware development tool designed to play nicely with all of the .Net languages including C#, Visual Basic.Net,\\nand Managed C++.\\nINDUSTRY SPOTLIGHT\\nHLLs in Industry\\nHLLs are important in every industry. One example is Python. Part of its purpose is to support data analytics\\nto process complex data, a major focus of many industries today.

They have been used to support rule-based approaches as part of the development\\nof artificial intelligence (AI), the simulation of human intelligence by machines such as computers.\\nThe most common language for logic-based programming is Prolog. It is used for both AI and linguistics\\nprogramming. It is actually an older HLL first developed in 1972 and has stayed with us, receiving extensive\\nupdating as AI developed. Figure 7.6 illustrates on the left side how facts and rules can be specified in Prolog.\\nThe query window on the right side illustrates how the Prolog fact database can be queried to leverage\\navailable rules.\\nFigure7.6 This sample program and query show the details of how to use Prolog. (attribution: Copyright Rice University, OpenStax,\\nunder CC BY 4.0 license)\\nThe Implementation of HLLs\\nAll computer languages can be grouped into particular categories. These are based upon support for certain\\nprogramming paradigms (standards, perspectives, or sets of ideas that may be used to describe the structure\\nand methodologies of an HLL). These paradigms include imperative/procedural, logical, functional, object-\\noriented, event-driven(the behavior of programs is controlled by actions (events) which are listened for and\\nthen acted upon or handled), and parallel programming (dividing a program into concurrent processes). Our\\nmodern HLLs are almost always hybrid combinations of these. We will learn about this in more detail in the\\nfollowing subsections of this chapter.\\nImperative/Procedural Programming\\nAs we have discussed, imperative HLLs take the “tell the computer what to do” approach. This approach is\\ndifferent from that of declarative HLLs that tell a program to obtain information without prescribing how the\\nprogram should go about doing it. Declarative languages are used to interact with systems that are\\nprogrammed to figure out these details. An example of a declarative language is Structured Query Language\\n(SQL), which is used to specify a query that a database system can process to store or retrieve data. Imperative\\nlanguages typically focus on evaluating expressions and storing results in variables. There are other shared\\nfeatures of these languages, such as iteration (looping or repetition).\\nProcedural languages extend the imperative paradigm. They make use of procedure calls to change the flow of\\ncontrol. A procedure (function) can be called from anywhere in a prog\\nCited Pages: 322, 323, 324\\n\\nSnippet 3:\\n}\\n};\\nLaunch the React app by running the following command:\\n$npm start\\nLaunch a browser with the MetaMask plug-in installed and navigate to http://localhost:3000.

The iOS operating system runs Apple’s device ecosystem, which includes iPhones, Apple TVs,\\nApple Watches, and more.\\nXcode is the primary IDE used for all Apple device development. Developers will code in Objective-C or Swift.\\nObjective-C was the primary development language for iOS; however, it was challenging to learn. In 2014,\\nApple released the Swift programming language specifically designed for iOS development. It offers high-\\norder language features, making it easier to develop software and built-in memory management, which\\nmakes less prone to crash.\\nINDUSTRY SPOTLIGHT\\nFramework Selection Based on Industry\\nNative application frameworks are important in every industry today. For example, mobile health\\napplications have become quite popular. Smartwatches can collect health-related data using various\\nsensors and mobile health applications can leverage that data to provide useful reports to users as they\\nexercise. Using a native application framework provides quicker load times, smooth animations and\\ntransitions, optimal security, and a seamless user experience, to make it easier to immediately track and\\naccess health-care data.\\nDrawbacks to using native application framework include a longer development process, increased cost,\\ncomplex maintenance and updates, platform dependency, regulatory and compliance issues, and end-user\\nbarriers.\\nThe Benefits and Drawbacks Between Native, Web, and Hybrid Mobile Application\\nDevelopment\\nNative applications have the benefits of accessing device-specific hardware and sensors (e.g., camera,\\naccelerometer), data (e.g., location, contacts), and are optimized for performance.\\nHowever, they have the drawbacks of being device-dependent and available primarily through proprietary app\\nstores (Google Play for Android and Apple’s App Store for iOS). Developers need to learn different languages\\nand libraries for the devices. However, cross-platform development is possible with frameworks (e.g., Flutter,\\nKotlin Multiplatform Mobile), allowing developers to code in a single language and run solutions on both\\nplatforms.\\nWeb apps can also run in a browser on mobile devices. They have the distinct advantage of responsiveness\\nand can run on various screen sizes—thus allo wing for a single codebase that can increase productivity and\\nreduce cost. Disadvantages to web apps on mobile devices are limited access to hardware and software\\nfeatures, lower performance than native apps, and web apps may perform differently depending on the\\nmobile browser. Traditionally, web apps didn’t look like native apps. In 2017, Google introduced Progressive\\nWeb Apps for Android, allowing web apps to look and feel similar to native apps.\\nFinally, hybrid apps are web apps wrapped inside a native device framework (e.g., Apache Cordova). These\\napps have the advantages of using traditional web application development while accessing and utilizing\\ndevice functions and running on multiple mobile platforms. The drawbacks are reduced speed and potential\\nsecurity vulnerabilities found in the framework.\\n11.1 • Modern Web Applications Architectures 575CONCEPTS IN PRACTICE\\nSoftware Patterns and Frameworks\\nAs discussed in Chapter 9 Software Engineering and Chapter 10 Enterprise and Solution Architectures\\nManagement, architectural styles, architectural patterns, and design patterns are typically used to enforce\\nthe quality attributes of software solutions. To facilitate the creation and maintenance of web applications\\nand scalable transactional websites, web application frameworks and native application frameworks that\\nleverage applicable patterns, such as MVC, were created and improved over the past couple of decades.\\nWeb frameworks are used within web application frameworks to facilitate the use of HTML5, CSS3, and\\nJavaScript and to publish responsive web pages that can be rendered by modern browsers on all modern\\ntarget devices. Web application frameworks help process UI-driven requests that result in publishing or\\nupdating web pages. Native application frameworks take advantage of capabilities available on specific\\ntarget devices such as iPhones and Android phones. Organizations in many industries rely on web\\napplications and related frameworks to conduct business daily.\\nWeb 3.0 Applications\\nWeb 3.0 is the next phase of the Web. It is still being realized, and similar to Web 1.0 and 2.0, it can only be\\nfully understood in hindsight. The technology and uses of the Web overlap between the phases, with newer\\nphases becoming preferred over their predecessor phases. If Web 1.0 was the read-only web, and Web 2.0 was\\nthe participation (write) web, then Web 3.0 may be the read, write, and execute web.\\nTim Berners-Lee had referred to Web 3.0 as the Semantic Web, a system of autonomous agents, which are\\nsoftware programs that respond to events. That model has shifted over the years. While AI (and other\\ntechnologies such as AR/VR) will likely form a part of Web 3.0 or Web x.0, the principles that govern the next\\nphase are expected to be around a web that is decentralized, permissionless, and trusted.\\nWeb 3.0 sees a shift from the more traditional client-server model to a peer-to-peer networking model. A peer-\\nto-peer network is one in which devices connect and can share data and processing without needing a\\ncentralized server. Peers in this scheme can perform the role of a traditional client, server, or both. This shift\\nwill foster a trusted, decentralized, and open web, where large companies don’t own the data, but everyone\\ncollectively owns it. Technologies such as a smart contract allow a trusted model that is needed in a\\ndecentralized system.

One application is an AI-image\\ngenerator website and auction house for selling images. An outside consultant has been brought in, and they\\nhave determined that a hybrid Web 2.0/3.0 architecture is best suited for this solution. However, the\\nengineering team who will perform the work needs to gain experience with Web 3.0 technologies. Therefore,\\nthe consultant recommended that TechWorks take a popular internal desktop application for managing to-do\\nlists and re-create it as a hybrid Web 2.0/3.0-based application so engineers can gain practical experience with\\nvarious web application frameworks and technologies, with the added benefit of accessing their to-dos from\\nanywhere.\\nThe TechWorks engineering team has decided to perform iterative releases of the to-do application, starting\\nwith responsive web apps, as they will render well on various screen sizes, from large monitors to smaller\\ndisplays like phones and tablets. Next, they will employ a native web application framework to target specific\\ndevices like Android and iPhones. Lastly, they will explore building a Web 2.0/3.0-based to-do application using\\nblockchain technology, as they believe this approach will give them the necessary skills for creating future\\nsolutions.\\nWeb Applications Development\\n11\\n11.1 Modern Web Applications Architectures\\nLearning Objectives\\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\\n• Understand the use of server-side rendering and MVC patterns\\n• Relate to the technology used to create responsive Web 2.0 applications\\n• Become familiar with the technology used to create native mobile applications\\n• Understand how to create Web 3.0 applications as well as hybrid Web 2.0/3.0 applications\\nThe World Wide Web, or the Webas it is known today, started as a way to link content (primarily text and\\nimages) stored on different servers or machines. It was invented by Tim Berners-Lee in 1989 while he worked\\nas a researcher at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN), home to the European Particle\\nPhysics Laboratory. Sir Tim Berners-Lee was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II in 2004 for his pioneering work. He\\ncreated the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) that operates on top of Transmission Control Protocol/Internet\\nProtocol (TCP/IP), the principal protocols used on the Internet. Clients (web browsers) transmit HTTP requests\\nto a web server, which is a software application that runs at a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) that specifies a\\nlocation on the Web to access it, and responds by providing pages rendered in the hypertext markup language\\n(HTML). This simple request and response paradigm, a client-server model, was easy to implement and\\nallowed for the rapid growth of the Web. This phase of the Web, which began after 1989 and ended around\\n2004, would become known as Web 1.0, a period where the user’s interaction was limited primarily to reading\\nand selecting web pages. A web pageis a document commonly written in HTML and viewed in a browser.\\nFigure 11.2 shows a simple Web 1.0 architecture and common usage. An encryption layer was later added to\\nthe HTTP protocol, which resulted in creating the HTTPS protocol. This made it possible to protect the sharing\\nof sensitive information over the Web from eavesdropping attacks. While web servers only served web pages\\ninitially, a Common Gateway Interface (CGI) was subsequently added after the initial implementation of web\\nservers to make it possible to link to applications via URLs on the Web.\\nFigure11.2 This architecture outlines a user’s interaction with a Web 1.0 website. (attribution: Copyright Rice University, OpenStax,\\nunder CC BY 4.0 license)\\nAs the Web evolved from this basic architecture, the need for more dynamic and interactive experiences\\nbecame apparent. Users were no longer content with simply viewing static pages; they wanted to contribute\\ncontent and engage with other users. Also called online publishing, web publishingpublishes content on the\\nWeb while applying traditional publishing models. It was akin to digitizing an encyclopedia (images and text)\\n566 11 • Web Applications Development\\nAccess for free at openstax.organd putting it online with hyperlinks. Today, simple websites with limited functionality, such as early blogs or\\nstatic sites, still follow this model.

Peers in this scheme can perform the role of a\\ntraditional client, server, or both. This shift fosters a trusted, decentralized, and open web, where large\\ncompanies do not own the data, but rather where data is collectively owned by users. The use of other\\ntechnologies like generative artificial intelligence (GenAI), which is powered by machine learning, aims to\\n11.1 • Modern Web Applications Architectures 567improve information access by mediating end-user searches to generate corresponding meaningful\\ninformation out of the content available on the Web. While the benefits of artificial intelligence and machine\\nlearning are vast, enabling enhanced data processing and decision-making, it is equally important to consider\\nthe risks. These technologies can pose ethical concerns, such as data privacy issues, biased algorithms, and\\nthe potential for misuse, thus highlighting the importance of responsible development and implementation. In\\nparticular, while GenAI technology is appealing and can be successful in some cases, GenAI is also known to\\nhallucinate and generate unpredictable and often inaccurate responses to web searches. The exemplar apps\\nof the Web 3.0 and later phases are still to be determined. Still, if the previous phases of the Web are any\\nindication, it will fundamentally change how we operate in an ever-evolving technological world.\\nThroughout this section, we will discover how the application architectures found in Web 2.0 apps, native\\nmobile apps, and Web 3.0 apps are designed.\\nGLOBAL ISSUES IN TECHNOLOGY\\nImportance of Internationalization and Localization in Frameworks\\nWeb applications are used worldwide, and specific internationalization and localization requirements must\\nbe observed to facilitate the creation of web applications that people all over the world can use. This can be\\nchallenging. To meet internationalization and localization prerequisites, services and products must be\\nflexible to compete in international markets. This includes having the malleability to adapt to the cultural\\nneeds of target markets around the world. In global markets, language barriers are just one\\ninternationalization and localization issue that must be considered for web applications.1\\nServer-Side Rendering and MVC Patterns\\nThe Web transitioned from its 1.0 phase, where the primary usage was viewing content composed of text and\\nimages, to its 2.0 phase of user interaction. As it evolved, three technologies dominated the Web’s\\nprogramming landscape, commonly referred to as the trifecta:\\n• hypertext markup language (HTML): a standard markup language used to describe the structure and\\ncontent of web pages.\\n• cascading style sheets (CSS): a standard style sheet language used to alter the presentation style of the\\ncontent found in HTML (or other markup languages).\\n• JavaScript (JS): a scripting language that adds interactivity to web content and server-side functionality.\\nVarious other scripting languages and competing approaches were used prior to the adoption of\\nJavaScript.\\nThe adoption of HTML was already a given on the Web, and with the introduction of CSS in 1996, a stronger\\npush for separating content and style was introduced so that the styling of content could be specified solely as\\npart of style sheets rather than HTML tags. Web pages at this time mostly consisted of static content, which\\nwould be generated and delivered on the web server. Essentially, the user would select an action in their\\nbrowser that sent an HTTP request to the server such as the following:\\n• When clicking a hyperlink on a web page, the browser would send an HTTP GET request to the web server.\\nThis request asked for a specific resource (such as a web page or an image), and the server would respond\\nby sending the requested data back to the browser.\\n• When filling out a form on a web page and clicking the submit button, the browser would send an HTTP\\nPOST request to the server. This request included the data that was entered (like a username and\\npassword), and the server processed it and responded accordingly.\\n1 To learn more, check out Lionbridge’s blog (https://openstax.org/r/76Lionbridge) post about globalization.\\n568 11 • Web Applications Development\\nAccess for free at openstax.orgEssentially, the web server performed all the HTML content rendering on the server side, and the client (web\\nbrowser) would present what it received. The browser in this model acts as a thin client, as it has minimal\\nfunctionality. Figure 11.4 illustrates the components of a traditional Web 2.0 architecture using Java-based\\ntechnologies. Notice the shift in user interaction with the website compared with a Web 1.0 website. Also note\\nthat users are able to interact with applications via an application server that can retrieve data from a database\\nor file system. This enables support for managing web sessions that allow navigation across multiple pages.\\nFigure11.4 This illustrates a user’s interaction with a traditional Web 2.0 architecture. (attribution: Copyright Rice University,\\nOpenStax, under CC BY 4.0 license)\\nMany of the original web applications were stateless, meaning that prior requests had no bearing on future\\nrequests. For example, it was not possible to create a shopping cart as part of a web session that would keep\\ntrack of the session and what was purchased on a site and maintain the state (i.e., content in this case) of the\\ncart. In contrast, a stateful applicationis software that maintains the state of an application over time, while\\nin the case of a stateless application, state is not maintained by the system and previous actions do not\\nimpact future ones. Stateless applications are simpler and easier to implement and maintain but offer limited\\nfunctionality.\\nAs previously mentioned, Web 2.0 was partly driven by user demand for more interactive functionality.\\nInteractivity requires maintaining some state (e.g., the web session and the content of the cart as per the\\nprevious example), thereby increasing the system’s complexity. This increased the demands on the web server\\nfor almost all the processing needed to generate and present the website content. Increased functionality led\\nto more complex systems, and a clear separation of responsibility between the website’s rendition, business\\nlogic (i.e., the logic implemented as part of the web application), and persistence layers were needed to\\nimprove the quality and performance of the website while leveraging engineering expertise in given domains.\\nAs you learned in Chapter 10 Enterprise and Solution Architectures Management, the Model-View-Controller\\npattern is tailored to address this separation of responsibility.

Mobile web applications and native versions of such are also\\navailable on smartphones and watches to help do the same. How does using web and native application\\nframeworks help people in everyday life? Provide a couple of illustrative scenarios to explain your opinion.\\nYour scenarios should not be limited to describing how the frameworks are used, but rather describe\\nsituations where these frameworks are applied in real life.\\nHybrid Web 2.0/3.0 Applications\\nDue to the qualities and limitations of Web 2.0 and 3.0 architectures, it is likely that we’ll see solutions that are\\na combination of the two approaches and leverage their best attributes. One way to do this would be to have\\nworkflow processes that require a high rate of change implemented in a Web 2.0 architecture, while processes\\nthat would benefit from using a distributed ledger being executed in Web 3.0. For example, traditional\\ncommercial websites can keep using the Web 2.0 architecture, while payment solutions can be extended by\\naccessing the Web 3.0 architecture to make payments using cryptocurrencies (e.g., Bitcoin).\\nLet’s consider an app for generating AI artwork. Many solutions exist today for doing this; however, we want\\nour app to give “ownership” to the digital artwork a person generates. AI models are trained to recognize\\nexisting artwork (e.g., paintings available via the wikiart.org API) that may be copyrighted—so o wnership is still\\nbeing determined in the courts. Here, the term ownership is used to attribute AI image creation and nothing\\nmore. While AI models are very popular, some companies do not want to share data with AI model creators\\nand prefer to have the AI models deployed in their own infrastructure to ensure full privacy. A non-fungible\\ntoken (NFT)is a unique digital identifier on a blockchain that a user may want to create of their image and\\npossibly sell (i.e., transfer ownership) on a marketplace. A common use case for this app might be:\\n1. A user logs in to the website and enters a prompt to generate an image.\\n2. After several rounds of adjusting their prompts, they end up with an image they want.\\n3. The user pays to have a non-fungible token created of the image, which is stored on a blockchain\\nmarketplace for sale.\\nAs you can imagine, running an AI image generator on a blockchain might not perform well. Likewise, creating\\nNFTs without blockchain technologies is counterintuitive. Therefore, the architecture for this solution needs to\\nencompass both Web 2.0 and 3.0 approaches.\\nFigure 11.13 shows how the APIs will do the heavy lifting of working with the AI model to generate the\\nartwork. Once the user is satisfied, they will interact with aspects of the UI that execute smart contracts to\\ngenerate and add the NFT to the blockchain. Transactions will happen on the blockchain. APIs may interact\\ndirectly with the blockchain, looking for similar works.\\n582 11 • Web Applications Development\\nAccess for free at openstax.orgFigure11.13 This outlines the user’s interaction with a hybrid Web 2.0/3.0 application.

These applications followed a Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) pattern. Figure 11.7\\nillustrates the relationship between the View, ViewModel, and Model components.\\nFigure11.7 Various data binding, events, and actions occur between the components of the Model-View-ViewModel pattern.\\n(attribution: Copyright Rice University, OpenStax, under CC BY 4.0 license)\\nThis pattern is like the MVC pattern we’ve previously explored; however, several key differences exist. The\\nfollowing are some of the similarities and differences:\\n• The View is responsible for the presentation and only interacts with the ViewModel. This is similar in\\nresponsibility to the View role and interaction with the Controller in the MVC pattern. The View here binds\\nto functions and properties in the ViewModel and receives notifications on operations and changes to the\\ndata. It doesn’t interact directly with the Model.\\n• The Model is similar to the Model in the MVC pattern and is responsible for data retrieval and storage. It\\ndoesn’t know anything about the ViewModel.\\n• The ViewModel is similar to the Controller in that it decouples the relationship between the View and\\nModel and handles data manipulation. The ViewModel responds to notifications from the Model and will\\nsend events to the View if needed. Because the View binds to the ViewModel, the ViewModel doesn’t know\\nanything about the View. The ViewModel can work with a local Model in the browser, a remote Model, or\\n572 11 • Web Applications Development\\nAccess for free at openstax.orgboth.\\nUnlike the previous MVC pattern regarding server-side rendering, the MVVM pattern is run entirely in the\\nclient. A Representational State Transfer (REST) API decouples the client-side Model and ViewModel\\ncomponents from the server-side business logic and persistence store. REST-based (aka RESTful) APIs follow\\nthe architecture style designed for the Web. These APIs use the JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)file format\\nthat represents data as text-based attribute-value information. Figure 11.8 illustrates the MVVM pattern as it\\napplies to an SPA.\\nFigure11.8 This illustrates the Model-View-ViewModel pattern as applied to the SPA architecture. (attribution: Copyright Rice\\nUniversity, OpenStax, under CC BY 4.0 license)\\nAs you can see from the diagram, this model is more complex than the simpler MVC pattern. The quality of the\\nAPIs partly determines the effectiveness of this pattern. REST-based APIs benefit from being discoverable (i.e.,\\nall API URIs can be found from the root API node) and should be versioned (i.e., to keep track of changes to\\ninterfaces for compatibility purposes) so that upgrades don’t break API users. Without API versioning, coupling\\nbetween client and server increases (due to semantic and syntactic coupling), and upgrades become costly.\\nSimilar to a URL, a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) is a string of characters that identifies a resource on the\\nWeb.\\nRegardless of these flaws, early browser-based frameworks proved the value of creating rich client-side apps.\\nWeb standards evolved, and newer frameworks emerged that adhered to the newer standards and solved\\nmany of the problems of their predecessors. Popular SPA frameworks include Angular, Ember.js, React, and\\nVue.js. These are often used in conjunction with server-side tools, creating a “full stack” of technologies for\\ndeveloping the solution. A popular server-side technology in this stack is Node, a runtime environment for\\nexecuting JavaScript code.\\nApproaches to minimizing the data transferred between the APIs and the client to reduce network traffic or\\nsimplifying access to the data resulted in two primary approaches. One was flattening the data model. Instead\\nof returning data in a nested format (such as from a relational database), the returned data would be\\n“flattened” to a series of key-value pairs, each resulting in a unique return value. If the specific request could\\nbe made, the flattened data would be preferred to navigating the nested data to improve performance.\\nHowever, creating APIs to fit specific requests could be challenging. Another solution was using GraphQL, an\\nopen-source query and manipulation language. With GraphQL, callers of its API could craft specific requests to\\nreturn only the needed data, which made access to many services such as the ones provided by microservices\\n11.1 • Modern Web Applications Architectures 573architectures more scalable.\\nTHINK IT THROUGH\\nFramework Selection\\nGiven that many web and native application frameworks are available today, is there a process that\\nfacilitates the selection of these frameworks?\\nNative Mobile Applications\\nNative mobile applications are designed to run on specific mobile operating systems (i.e., Android, iOS).\\nAndroid and iOS operating systems dominate the mobile device market.

High-level languages (HLLs) give programmers the ability to produce linguistic\\nrealizations of algorithms using a notational system that facilitates human-computer interaction.\\nTechWorks is an example of a company focused on new technology; for it to leverage technology and fulfill its\\nstated mission, it regularly makes decisions on which HLLs to use, what exactly to use them for, and many\\nother HLL suitability factors such as the following:\\n• Types of application\\n• Target platforms\\n• Maintainability\\n• Scalability\\n• Performance\\n• Security\\nTechWorks will need to choose from a pool of programming languages that excel in different areas. For\\nexample, JavaScript is a versatile language that applies to the interactive elements that users will see and\\ninteract with when using TechWorks’s web interfaces. JavaScript is a natural choice for this task due to its\\nability to create dynamic and engaging user experiences. For server-side operations, the choice of\\nprogramming languages must strike a balance between latest technology needs and experienced\\nHigh-Level Programming Languages\\n7\\nprogrammers’ preferences. JavaScript with frameworks like Node offers a cutting-edge approach, while\\nestablished languages like PHP or ASP.NET boast a larger pool of seasoned programmers. TechWorks will need\\nto use the Structured Query Language (SQL) to communicate with database systems used to support its\\napplications. Python is a powerful tool language for data analysis and manipulation. Its extensive libraries and\\nclear syntax make it well-suited to extract insights from TechWorks’s collected data. In a nutshell, TechWorks\\nwill need to strategically combine the use of various programming languages to create robust and user-\\nfriendly applications.\\n7.1 Programming Language Foundations\\nLearning Objectives\\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\\n• Describe what HLLs are\\n• Summarize choosing appropriate HLLs\\n• Outline the history of HLLs\\n• Describe the implementation of HLLs\\nA high-level programming language is designed to be easy for humans to read, write, and understand. It\\nabstracts away most of the complexities of the underlying hardware and machine code, allowing programmers\\nto focus on solving problems and designing software without needing to manage the low-level details of the\\ncomputer’s architecture.\\nWhat Are HLLs?\\nHigh-level programming languages give humans the ability to direct computers to perform tasks and\\napplications. There are many HLLs to choose from. Java is a popular choice for its ability to run on various\\noperating systems (i.e., Windows, macOS, Linux) and mobile platforms (Android). This is called cross-platform\\ncompatibility. For development specifically targeting Windows systems, C# is another strong option.\\nAdditionally, to create the visual elements of a website, programmers can utilize HTML and CSS. HTML\\nprovides the structure and content of the web page, while CSS controls how web pages are styled and\\npresented. Over time, many HLLs have evolved into a mature set of tools that are used to create modern\\napplications (Figure 7.2).\\n304 7 • High-Level Programming Languages\\nAccess for free at openstax.orgFigure7.2 High-level programming languages have advanced from the foundational languages in the middle of the 20th century to\\nmore than 2500 HLLs that exist today. (attribution: Copyright Rice University, OpenStax, under CC BY 4.0 license)\\nLINK TO LEARNING\\nThere is a possibility that the widespread use of a variety of HLLs to develop networked and mobile\\napplications at a global scale creates potential cybersecurity issues. Some HLLs are considered more secure\\nthan others. Read this article on the most secure programming languages (https://openstax.org/r/\\n76ProgLanguages) for further information about the security—or lack ther eof—of these languages.\\nLearning Motivations\\nStudying the fundamental concepts provided by various HLLs is necessary to choose them correctly, employ\\nthem effectively, and program efficiently. From a user point of view, examining HLL concepts helps the user\\nget better at thinking and expressing algorithms. From an implementor’s point of view, understanding HLL\\nconcepts helps programmers abstract away from (virtual) machines and become better at specifying what they\\nwant the hardware to do without getting down into the bits. In the end, studying HLL concepts helps\\nprogrammers make better use of whatever HLL they use.\\nImplementing Abstraction\\nOne way to relate to abstractionis as a way of thinking and expressing algorithms to indicate what the\\nprogrammer wants the hardware to do. For example, the following statement represents one form of\\nabstraction in the Java programming language:\\nSystem.out.println(\"Hello world!\");\\nIt tells the computer’s operating system at a high-level of abstraction to output a string of characters, which\\n7.1 • Programming Language Foundations 305practically consists of moving the pixels that form characters one by one to a hardware device.\\nImplementing a high level of tasks would be impossible without abstraction. For example, you would not want\\nto program an invoicing application in 1s and 0s (machine language); abstraction allows a programmer to\\nbuild it in an English-like syntax.\\nAbstraction may be taken to much higher levels. It is one of three central principles (along with encapsulation\\nand inheritance) in such object-oriented HLLs as C++, Java, C#, and Python. Various programming paradigms\\nwere introduced in Chapter 4 Linguistic Realization of Algorithms: Low-Level Programming Languages,\\nparticularly the mechanisms of object-oriented programming (OOP) and its standards, perspectives, or sets of\\nideas that may be used to describe the structure and methodologies of an HLL. Object-oriented HLLs help\\norganize software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic, as we will discuss in\\nAlternative Programming Models.\\nChoosing Appropriate HLLs\\nStudying and understanding HL\\nCited Pages: 312, 313, 314, 315, 316\\n\\nSnippet 14:\\nnsibility between the website’s rendition, business\\nlogic (i.e., the logic implemented as part of the web application), and persistence layers were needed to\\nimprove the quality and performance of the website while leveraging engineering expertise in given domains.\\nAs you learned in Chapter 10 Enterprise and Solution Architectures Management, the Model-View-Controller\\npattern is tailored to address this separation of responsibility. In the MVC pattern, the Model is the persistence\\nlayer responsible for data storage and retrieval. It has a well-defined API that the Controller uses. The Viewis\\nthe presentation layer that handles the user interface. Finally, the Controller acts as the business logic layer\\nthat performs processing and enforces rules to generate applicable content within a given application domain\\nand separates the user interface from the data. It also has a well-defined API that the View understands. The\\nbest-practice design concept used to create software systems in a way that ensures weak associations with\\nother components is called loose coupling. This concept allows for separation of concerns between\\ncomponents, which leads to maintaining high cohesion within websites’ functionalities. MVC components are\\nloosely coupled in that the various components can interact with one another to access the specific\\n11.1 • Modern Web Applications Architectures 569functionalities provided by each component. High cohesion ensures that everything that is needed to provide\\na specific functionality is included in one of the components. For example, on a banking website, functionality\\nfor deposits and withdrawals may be collocated on the server within the same component to ensure high\\ncohesion; however, features for applying for a loan may be located within another component. Three popular\\nserver-side web application frameworks that implemented the MVC pattern were Apache Struts, ASP.NET, and\\nRuby on Rails.\\nCONCEPTS IN PRACTICE\\nAPIs Play a Large Role in Web Services\\nUnderstanding APIs and their protocols helps determine which platform is being accessed and at what\\nlevel. APIs allow access to any software with a specific purpose or functionality. APIs can be used as\\ncontracts between multiple applications.\\nHow do APIs work? The API architecture is usually explained in terms of client and server. The application\\nsending the request is called the client, and the application sending the response is called the server. For\\nexample, in the case of an API for a weather service, the weather service database is maintained on the\\nserver side, and the mobile app is running on a client mobile device.\\nThe server side performs the majority of the functionality. It uses a combination of templated HTML, controller\\nand application server technologies (e.g., ASP.NET, C#), and SQL. JavaScript is sent to the browser using jQuery\\nfor cross-browser support, or it may use Asynchronous JavaScript and XML to communicate with the web\\nserver without refreshing the page. Asynchronous JavaScript and XML (AJAX)exchanges small amounts of\\ndata between a client and server. The engineering team using such a web platform must understand and\\nenforce the separation of responsibilities between the MVC components to ensure future modifications,\\nespecially significant changes, can be made without rearchitecting the system. Because the engineering team\\nneeds to know different programming languages for different layers, there may be some internal resistance to\\nthis, and it may be tempting to go around a layer to make a quick fix. Essentially, making sure that the\\narchitecture of the web platform is understood and used properly, architectural adherence is predicated on\\nthe expertise of the engineering team members and more on the nature of the tools used.\\nResponsive Web 2.0 Applications\\nBy the mid-2000s, JavaScript became popular for client-side browser functionality. AJAX and jQuery\\ntechnologies allowed developers to create single-page applications (SPA). For the end user, SPAs offered\\nfunctionality like a traditional desktop application and drastically improved user experience by reducing\\nlatency. No longer were expensive web server requests needed that resulted in full page refreshes in the\\nbrowser. Instead, small data transmissions could be sent and received between the browser and server\\nthrough AJAX. Figure 11.5 compares the life cycle of SPAs to a traditional Web 2.0 application.\\n570 11 • Web Applications Development\\nAccess for free at openstax.orgFigure11.5 This is a comparison of the life cycles between traditional Web 2.0 applications and SPAs. (attribution: Copyright Rice\\nUniversity, OpenStax, under CC BY 4.0 license)\\nLINK TO LEARNING\\nThe World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) (https://openstax.org/r/76W3C) develops standards and guidelines\\nfor the Web. You can discover more about them and examine some of their current draft standards.\\njQuery, an open-source JavaScript library, ensured that web developers could write JavaScript for a generic\\nbrowser document object model (DOM) that would run regardless of the user’s browser. The DOM is a\\nprogramming interface provided by browsers. It allows scripts, written in JavaScript for example, to interact\\nwith the structure of a web page. When a web page is loaded into the browser, the browser creates a DOM of\\nthe page. The DOM structure is a hierarchical treelike structure that organizes the elements of the page as\\nobjects. The model used by the DOM enables dynamic access and facilitates the manipulation of content,\\nstructure, and style of web pages. Figure 11.6 illustrates a typical SPA architecture where a single web page is\\ndelivered to the browser. Note that in this model, the user’s interaction with the site has increased in the\\namount of content generated by the user.\\n11.1 • Modern Web Applications Architectures 571\\nCited Pages: 579, 580, 581\\n\\nSnippet 15:\\nand putting it online with hyperlinks. Today, simple websites with limited functionality, such as early blogs or\\nstatic sites, still follow this model. A more interactive model that could scale to meet user demand was needed\\nto support users’ desire to provide content and interact with other users. A design pattern is a reusable\\nsolution to a common software design problem. Figure 11.3 illustrates the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design\\npattern that was employed to separate a traditional web application’s data model, presentation, and business\\nlogic layers into its components.\\nFigure11.3 This figure shows a user’s interaction with the Model-View-Controller pattern. (attribution: Copyright Rice University,\\nOpenStax, under CC BY 4.0 license)\\nThe original implementation of the MVC pattern on the Web was such that the View would send requests to\\nthe Controller and the Controller obtained data from the Model and rendered it within HTML pages that were\\npassed to browsers for presentation purposes. AJAX technology was later introduced to enable a more\\ncomplete implementation of MVC on the Web that allowed asynchronous updates to page components and\\ndid not require refreshing pages in the browser to fetch data.\\nFollowing Moore’s law, which states that the number of transistors on an integrated circuit doubles roughly\\nevery two years, the processing power of smaller devices like laptops, tablets, and mobile phones became the\\npreferred way users interacted on the Web. As Internet data transfer speeds and bandwidth increased through\\nbetter hardware, fiber-optic cables, and mobile wireless technology, the rendering of web applications’\\ninteractive interfaces moved from the server side to the client side. This led to being able to run native\\napplications (apps) on mobile wireless phones that could take advantage of specific device rendering features.\\nIn a paradigm shift that was opposite to web apps, the data model moved off the phone and onto remote\\nservers. These solutions led to a richer user experience known as Web 2.0, which is a phase of the Web\\nfocused on social interactions. This phase started in 2004, and social media websites using Web 2.0, such as\\nFacebook (now Meta) and Twitter (now X), are well-known examples of this web phase of social interactivity.\\nThe next phase of the web, Web 3.0, which is a phase of the Web where user activities may focus on\\ndecentralized access to solutions and data, is seeing a shift from the more traditional client-server model to a\\npeer-to-peer networking model. A peer-to-peer (P2P)network is one in which devices connect and can share\\ndata and processing without needing a centralized server. Peers in this scheme can perform the role of a\\ntraditional client, server, or both. This shift fosters a trusted, decentralized, and open web, where large\\ncompanies do not own the data, but rather where data is collectively owned by users. The use of other\\ntechnologies like generative artificial intelligence (GenAI), which is powered by machine learning, aims to\\n11.1 • Modern Web Applications Architectures 567\\nCited Pages: 577\\n\\nSnippet 16:\\n of\\nideas that may be used to describe the structure and methodologies of an HLL. Object-oriented HLLs help\\norganize software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic, as we will discuss in\\nAlternative Programming Models.\\nChoosing Appropriate HLLs\\nStudying and understanding HLL concepts allows us to make most efficient use of them by becoming familiar\\nwith various criteria that may be used to evaluate them, which helps us choose the most appropriate language\\nfor a project. Some of these criteria are listed in Table 7.1, which also shows how they are related to the\\ncharacteristics of an HLL. These criteria are as follows:\\n• readability: measures how easily an HLL can be read and understood\\n• writability: measures how easily an HLL can be used to create and modify programs\\n• reliability: measures conformance to specifications\\nThere are many other criteria including scalability, cost, flexibility, efficiency, portability, and maintainability.\\nThese can be used to identify which HLL is best suited for a given task.\\nCharacteristic Readability Writability Reliability\\nSimplicity: a manageable set of features and constructs • • •\\nOrthogonality: a relatively small set of primitive constructs can\\nbe combined in a relatively small number of ways • • •\\nData types: adequate predefined constructs to hold data • • •\\nSyntax design: form and meaning via self-descriptive constructs\\nand meaningful keywords • • •\\nSupports abstraction: hides all but the relevant data about an\\nobject in order to reduce complexity and increase efficiency • •\\nExpressivity: relatively convenient ways of specifying operations • •\\nType checking: built-in testing for type mismatches •\\nTable7.1 Criteria for Measuring Characteristics of HLLs\\n306 7 • High-Level Programming Languages\\nAccess for free at openstax.orgCharacteristic Readability Writability Reliability\\nException handling: support for catching run-time errors and\\nspecifying corrective measures •\\nRestricted aliasing: presence of two or more distinct referencing\\nmethods for the same memory location •\\nTable7.1 Criteria for Measuring Characteristics of HLLs\\nLearning New HLLs\\nStudying the concepts of HLLs makes it easier to learn new HLLs since most have similarities in syntax,\\nstructure, and semantics. There are also several best practices that apply to different HLLs. A best practiceis\\nthe most accepted style and structure of code that can be used to ensure proper software development, which\\nmakes it possible to learn new languages easily once a programmer has mastered a given one. The HLLs that\\nare most used as teaching languages today are Java, C++, and Python. Java and C++ are languages that take a\\nsignificant amount of study to master, while Python is considered a much simpler language to learn.\\nLINK TO LEARNING\\nHTML and CSS are markup languages and not exactly programming languages like Java or Python. The\\nofficial HTML and CSS standards (https://openstax.org/r/76HTMLCSSStds) are available at World Wide Web\\nConsortium (W3C).\\nBest Use of HLLs\\nProgrammers have to figure out how HLLs support certain features. For example, a variablegives a name to a\\nmemory location that is used in any HLL to hold a value. However, different languages use variables differently.\\nJava is a strongly typedlanguage, meaning that a variable may only contain a value of one of the language’s\\ndefined data types for its entire existence. Therefore, a variable that is a number cannot become a string of\\ntext. JavaScript is weakly typedso a variable may at different times hold values of any of the language data\\ntypes. It may be storing a number, then later, the same variable may store a string of characters.\\nAnother example is the use of pointers in C and C++. As visible in Figure 7.3, the pointer is the variable that\\nholds actual computer memory addresses, but they do not exist in Java. However, understanding how C\\nhandles memory makes it easier to understand how data is passed from one place to another in Java or C#.\\n7.1 • Programming Language Foundations 307Figure7.3 A C pointer variable “a” holds the memory address of the “b” variable. (attribution: Copyright Rice University, OpenStax,\\nunder CC BY 4.0 license)\\nLanguages Are Purpose Driven\\nLet’s again contrast C/C++ and JavaScript. Much of the syntax and grammar are the same, as are the flow of\\ncontrol structures of the language.\\nLINK TO LEARNING\\nYou can review the current C/C++ standard (https://openstax.org/r/76C++Standard) to dig deeper into a\\nsyntax comparison.\\nSo why pick one over the other? The answer is that languages are designed to fulfill certain purposes. C/C++ is\\na general-purpose programming language. As such, it is powerful for applications that include both systems\\nprogramming and object-oriented graphical user interface (GUI) programming, JavaScript is intended for web\\nprogramming.\\nAlthough programming languages differ in syntax, they all have libraries or packages that are installed as part\\nof the language development environment. These libraries expose various functions via an application\\nprogramming interface (API). These functions support the tasks for which the language is purposed while not\\nrequiring additional coding. The following illustrates the use of a C++ library function that prints a string to the\\nscreen:\\ncout << \"Hello world!\";\\nJavaScript’s API contains a comprehensive set of features that enable the manipulation and dynamic behavior\\nof web pages. A JavaScript API function that prints to the web page:\\ndocument.write(\"Hello world!\");\\nTECHNOLOGY IN EVERYDAY LIFE\\nUsing Map APIs to Navigate Your World\\nAPIs are toolkits for programmers.
