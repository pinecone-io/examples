    "* [Filtering by metadata](https://docs.pinecone.io/guides/search/filter-by-metadata): When records contain additional metadata, you can limit the search to records matching a filter expression.\n",

    "\n",
    "* [Chunking strategies](https://www.pinecone.io/learn/chunking-strategies/): You can chunk your content in different ways to get better results. Consider factors like the length of the content, the complexity of queries, and how results will be used in your application."
