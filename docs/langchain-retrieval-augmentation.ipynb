Although a believer in the superiority of the Italian nation and national unity, Mussolini, unlike Hitler, is quoted \"Race? It is a feeling, not a reality. Nothing will ever make me believe that biologically pure races can be shown to exist today\".\\n\\nMussolini wanted Italy to become a new Roman Empire. In 1923, he attacked the island of Corfu, and in 1924, he occupied the city state of Fiume. In 1935, he attacked the African country Abyssinia (now called Ethiopia). His forces occupied it in 1936. Italy was thrown out of the League of Nations because of this aggression. In 1939, he occupied the country Albania. In 1936, Mussolini signed an alliance with Adolf Hitler, the dictator of Germany.\\n\\nFall from power and death\\nIn 1940, he sent Italy into the Second World War on the side of the Axis countries. Mussolini attacked Greece, but he failed to conquer it. In 1943, the Allies landed in Southern Italy. The Fascist party and King Vittorio Emanuel III deposed Mussolini and put him in jail, but he was set free by the Germans, who made him ruler of the Italian Social Republic puppet state which was in a small part of Central Italy. When the war was almost over, Mussolini tried to escape to Switzerland with his mistress, Clara Petacci, but they were both captured and shot by partisans. Mussolini\\'s dead body was hanged upside-down, together with his mistress and some of Mussolini\\'s helpers, on a pole at a gas station in the village of Millan, which is near the border  between Italy and Switzerland.'),\n",

Italian soldiers won Latium in 1870. That was when they took away the Pope\\'s power. The Pope, who was angry, said that he was a prisoner to keep Catholic people from being active in politics. That was the year of Italian unification.\\n\\nItaly participated in World War I. It was an ally of Great Britain, France, and Russia against the Central Powers. Almost all of Italy\\'s fighting was on the Eastern border, near Austria. After the \"Caporetto defeat\", Italy thought they would lose the war. But, in 1918, the Central Powers surrendered. Italy gained the Trentino-South Tyrol, which once was owned by Austria.\\n\\nFascist Italy \\nIn 1922, a new Italian government started. It was ruled by Benito Mussolini, the leader of Fascism in Italy. He became head of government and dictator, calling himself \"Il Duce\" (which means \"leader\" in Italian). He became friends with German dictator Adolf Hitler. Germany, Japan, and Italy became the Axis Powers. In 1940, they entered World War II together against France, Great Britain, and later the Soviet Union. During the war, Italy controlled most of the Mediterranean Sea.'),\n",

The area included a group of separate states that were ruled by other countries (such as Austria, France, and Spain).  In the 1850s, the Earl of Camillo Benso, Count of Cavour was the head of government of the \"State of Sardinia\". He talked to the Austrians in Lombardy and Veneto and said they should create a Northern Italian state. This happened, but other Central and Southern Italian states also joined Piedmont to create a bigger state.\\n\\nKingdom of Italy \\n\\nIn 1860, Giuseppe Garibaldi took control of Sicily, creating the Kingdom of Italy in 1861. Victor Emmanuel II was made the king. In 1861, Latium and Veneto were still not part of Italy, because they were ruled by the Pope and Austrian Empire.')]}"
