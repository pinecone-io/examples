        "Lexical search is a form of retrieval that allows you to find records that most exactly match the words or phrases in a query. Lexical search uses sparse vectors, which have a very large number of dimensions, where only a small proportion of values are non-zero. The dimensions represent words from a dictionary, and the values represent the contextual importance of these words in the document. Words are scored independently and then summed, with the most similar records scored highest.\n",
