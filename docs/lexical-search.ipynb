        "Lexical search is a form of retrieval that allows you to find records that most exactly match the words or phrases in a query. Lexical search uses sparse vectors, which have a very large number of dimensions, where only a small proportion of values are non-zero. The dimensions represent words from a dictionary, and the values represent the contextual importance of these words in the document. Words are scored independently and then summed, with the most similar records scored highest.\n",

        "\n",
        "While semantic search (over a dense index) allows you to find records that are most similar in meaning and context to a query, lexical search (over a sparse index) lets you search for exact token matches like keywords, acronyms, stock tickers, or even proprietary domain terminology, like a product name.\n",
