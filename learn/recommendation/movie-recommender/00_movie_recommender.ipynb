        "This notebook demonstrates how Pinecone's similarity search as a service helps you build a simple Movie Recommender System. There are three parts to this recommender system:\n",
        "\n",
        "- A dataset containing movie ratings\n",
        "- Two deep learning models for embedding movies and users\n",
        "- A vector index to perform similarity search on those embeddings\n",
        "\n",
        "The architecture of our recommender system is shown below. We have two models, a user model and a movie model, which generate embedding for users and movies. The two models are trained such that the proximity between a user and a movie in the multi-dimensional vector space depends on the rating given by the user for that movie. This means if a user gives a high rating to a movie, the movie will be closer to the user in the multi-dimensional vector space and vice versa. This ultimately brings users with similar movie preferences and the movies they rated higher closer in the vector space. A similarity search in this vector space for a user would give new recommendations based on the shared movie preference with other users.\n",
