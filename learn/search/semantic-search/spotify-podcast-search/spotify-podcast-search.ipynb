    "Spotify used four data sources for training and evaluation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. *(query, episode)* pairs from successful podcast searches (found in past search logs)\n",
    "2. Where a successful podcast search occured *after* an initially unsuccessful search, *(query_prior_to_successful_reformulation, episode)* pairs were created. The idea is that these initial queries may be natural language queries that the user then changed to fit a more rigid search format.\n",
    "3. Generate synthetic queries from popular episode titles and descriptions. They fine-tuned a BART model on MS-MARCO and then used it to generate the queries, creating *(synthetic_query, episode)* pairs.\n",
    "4. A small curated set of *semantic* queries were manually written for popular podcast episodes, this is used for evaluation only.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately we don't have access to Spotify's past search logs and this rules out any emulation of sources **1** and **2**. Given enough time, sure we could curate a set of semantic queries, but we do not (feel free to do this if you want).\n",
    "\n",
    "That leaves us with option **3**. This is probably the most interesting technique used by Spotify, and fortunately we can replicate it. All we need is a dataset containing podcast metadata, which we can [find here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/listennotes/all-podcast-episodes-published-in-december-2017).\n",
