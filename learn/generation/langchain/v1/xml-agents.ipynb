A trained neural network takes a vector as input, crunches and transforms it in various ways, and produces another vector, often in some other space. An image may thereby be turned into a vector, a song into a sequence of vectors, and a social network as a structured collection of vectors. It seems as though much of human knowledge, or at least what is expressed as text, audio, image, and video, has a vector representation in one form or another.\\nIt should be noted that representing data as vectors is not unique to neural networks and deep learning. In fact, long before learnt vector representations of pieces of dataâ\\x80\\x94what is commonly known as â\\x80\\x9cembeddingsâ\\x80\\x9dâ\\x80\\x94came along, data was often encoded as hand-crafted feature vectors. Each feature quanti- fied into continuous or discrete values some facet of the data that was deemed relevant to a particular task (such as classification or regression). Vectors of that form, too, reflect our understanding of a real-world object or concept.',\n",

Testing conducted to date has been in English, and has not covered, nor could it cover all scenarios. For these reasons, as with all LLMs, Llama 2âs potential outputs cannot be predicted in advance, and the model may in some instances produce inaccurate or objectionable responses to user prompts. Therefore, before deploying any applications of Llama 2, developers should perform safety testing and tuning tailored to their speciï¬c applications of the model.

That said, these LLMs may produce code which will get easily caught if used directly.â\n",

For this second quantitative evaluation, we selected prompts that the red teamers generated specifically attempting to solicit malicious code (even though the red teaming included consideration of a broad set of safety risks). These prompts were a mix of clear intent and slightly obfuscated intentions (see some examples in Figure 15. We show a KDE plot of the distribution of the safety score for all models in Figure 7). We observe that Code Llama tends to answer with safer responses; the distribution of safety scores for Code Llama has more weight in the safer part of the range.\n",
