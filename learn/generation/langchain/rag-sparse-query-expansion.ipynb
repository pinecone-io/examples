        "In this example, we'll build an agent that can search through Reddit posts about stocks and financial markets\n",
        "using sparse embeddings. Unlike dense embeddings that capture overall semantic meaning, sparse embeddings excel at\n",
        "capturing specific keywords and rare terms - perfect for financial contexts where stock tickers (like AAPL, TSLA)\n",

        "## Why Sparse Embeddings for Financial Data?\n",
        "\n",
        "Financial discussions on platforms like Reddit often contain:\n",
        "1. Stock tickers (PLTR, NVDA) that need exact matching\n",
        "2. Company names that might be misspelled (Palanteer vs. Palantir)\n",
        "3. Industry-specific jargon that dense embeddings might miss\n",

        "Sparse embeddings shine here because they:\n",
        "- Maintain high precision for exact term matches (crucial for tickers)\n",
        "- Preserve term frequency information (how often a stock is mentioned)\n",
        "- Allow for better retrieval of documents with rare but important terms\n",

They're the second earnings report among the Magnificent Seven stocks which I'll be posting about on each of their earning days. Alphabet is following Tesla, which, despite disappointing results, gained after news of Elon Musk's increased involvement in the company's operations. \\n\\nSo for GOOG, are we going in on calls or puts? I figured we'd at least need to be informed with what's in the know before deciding. In light of the widespread weakness among leading Big Tech companies (all of these companies have experienced higher declines than the broader US market since the beginning of the year), today's Alphabet earnings will be a significant test of how the company operates in a new environment dominated by uncertainty. I'm not only going to be interested in the financial data but I wanna see the message from the management indicating to investors whether Alphabet is navigating safely through our currently uncertain market.\\n\\n**The Chart**\\n\\nFrom a [TA perspective](https://i.imgur.com/uE3nJVz.png) a double bottom pattern may be forming on Alphabet's chart. If today's earnings results turn out to be a positive surprise and the stock price climbs above the $160.77 level, it could signal a reversal of the downward trend that has been affecting the tech giant's shares since the beginning of 2025. \\n\\n**Earnings**\\n\\nFor Q1, it looks like the market is expecting Alphabet to report revenue of $89.1 billion (+11% y/y). From what I've read, operating income is expected to reach $28.58 billion (+12% y/y). This stronger profit growth implies a slight margin improvement to above 32.08% (+0.45 pp). Tbh, it looks like effective cost management will be one of the biggest challenges for Alphabet in this environment. While sustaining strong revenue growth seems less at risk, managing expenses (especially given capital-intensive AI development plans) will be challenging.\\n\\n**Cloud Services**\\n\\nFor those who are aware, Google Cloud is a thing and is driving massive growth for the company. With rivals signaling a slowdown in data center expansion amid rising uncertainty, Alphabet may either follow a cautious strategy (likely dampening growth) or seize the opportunity to gain market share by acting aggressively.\\n\\nThe second approach would be riskier and more costly, potentially causing erosion in the segment’s operating margin. It would, however, be an investment in the better future market position.\\n\\nI'm going to be watching not just the quarterly results but also the forward outlook and management’s tone regarding the Cloud business. It looks like the Forecasted Cloud segment has a revenue of $12.32 billion for Q1 2025. This would be the h[ighest quarterly result in Alphabet's history](https://i.imgur.com/9uWUntD.png). However, operating income is expected to slightly decline versus the prior quarter, but at $1.94 billion it would still be over twice the result from Q1 2024.\\n\\n**Tariffs** \\n\\nOne of the key topics that I'll especially be closely watching tonight is the impact of tariffs and macroeconomic uncertainty on the company’s operations. Among the major Big Tech companies, Alphabet has shown the greatest resilience to potential geopolitical turmoil and has often demonstrated the fastest recovery following periods of uncertainty.\\n\\nAt this point, they do not appear to be in significantly better shape than its peers, with its stock down approximately 17% year-to-date, placing it squarely in the middle of the Magnificent Seven stocks.\\n\\nI think the first step toward rebuilding investor confidence will be outlining the scope and impact of tariffs and overall geopolitical uncertainty on the company’s operations. As such, the types of questions I expect during today’s conference about how strongly tariffs will affect Alphabet’s business. It is worth noting that this isn’t necessarily about the direct impact (which is likely to be limited) but rather the indirect effect of uncertainty on the willingness of Alphabet’s clients to spend on advertising, which constitutes a significant portion of the company’s revenue.\\n\\n**Price Targets**\\n\\nAmid these earnings expectations, analysts have been revising Alphabet's price targets downward. Over the past few weeks, [several top analysts have revised their 12-month price targets for Alphabet](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/goog/forecast?utm_source=theglobeandmail.com&amp;utm_medium=referral). TD Cowen lowered its target from $210 to $195. UBS cut its target from $209 to $173. Even Scotiabank lowered its target from $232 to $200. Despite that, they all still rate GOOG stock as a Buy, showing they believe in its long-term value.\\n\\nGuggenheim lowered its target from $215 to $190, while Jefferies adjusted its target from $235 to $200, both maintaining a Buy rating. Piper Sandler and Citi followed suit, reducing their targets to $185 and $195 respectively, citing uncertainties in the advertising landscape and macroeconomic pressures.\\n\\nI mean. With all things considered, the stock is down 19% in 2025 so far. Combine that with rising legal risks (mentioned later here) and an uncertain economy, and you have a good reason to reframe expectations. Analysts aren’t necessarily predicting more downside; they’re just being more realistic about the upside, especially in the near term.\\n\\nIf we’re to simplify the analysts’ overall message, it’s that Alphabet’s fundamentals are strong, but the road ahead could be bumpy.\\n\\n**In the news**\\n\\nA federal court recently ruled that Google violated antitrust laws by monopolizing specific digital advertising markets. The court plans to determine suitable remedies soon. Some analysts believe the ruling could eventually lead to the divestiture of certain Google ad segments, though the financial impact on Alphabet is expected to be modest.\\n\\nThere’s also the bigger picture. Between global tariffs, economic uncertainty, and shifts in labor and costs across the tech industry, Alphabet has a lot on its plate. Investors will want to hear how the company manages expenses, hiring, and regional exposure.\\n\\n**Mergers and Acquisitions**\\n\\nAlphabet announced a $32 billion all-cash deal to acquire cloud security platform Wiz. This acquisition aims to enhance Google Cloud’s security capabilities and multi-cloud operations. Analysts are projecting long-term benefits from this acquisition, despite potential short-term market pressures on other cloud service providers.\\n\\nSeparately, Google has decided to maintain its current approach to offering third-party cookie choices in its Chrome browser, emphasizing the importance of online privacy and user control. This decision is part of Google's ongoing Privacy Sandbox initiative, which aims to strengthen online privacy while supporting a sustainable ad-driven internet environment.\\n\\n**What now?**\\n\\nAlphabet’s stock may be down, but most analysts still believe it’s a long-term winner. That’s why Buy ratings remain steady, even if price targets are down. Q1 earnings could be the reset moment Alphabet needs to win back momentum. I'm thinking short term puts for earnings but holding long term shares. Could even sell covered calls for earnings for some extra income, if you already have the shares. Avg price target is $204.\", 'subreddit': 'wallstreetbets', 'score': 6.03613281, 'url': 'https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1k70ero', 'matched_query': 'chipmakers stock recent developments'}, {'content': \"## A Very Rapid' Drop In Domestic Demand Is Hitting Airlines\\n\\n\\nComplement to a former post. \\nAny jump in airlines stock price is just dancing around for now\\n\\nThe Travel crisis that is emerging will affect other industries that profit from tourism, like real estate and Banks\\n\\nhttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/very-rapid-drop-domestic-demand-182820043.html\\n\\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/s/7nEvEsNjpp\\n\\nhttps://sherwood.news/business/us-airlines-in-a-recession-southwest-ceo/\\n\\nOn the international front, for majors Airlines, Chinese and other Asian international tourists are crucial to their long-haul operations.

They're the second earnings report among the Magnificent Seven stocks which I'll be posting about on each of their earning days. Alphabet is following Tesla, which, despite disappointing results, gained after news of Elon Musk's increased involvement in the company's operations. \\n\\nSo for GOOG, are we going in on calls or puts? I figured we'd at least need to be informed with what's in the know before deciding. In light of the widespread weakness among leading Big Tech companies (all of these companies have experienced higher declines than the broader US market since the beginning of the year), today's Alphabet earnings will be a significant test of how the company operates in a new environment dominated by uncertainty. I'm not only going to be interested in the financial data but I wanna see the message from the management indicating to investors whether Alphabet is navigating safely through our currently uncertain market.\\n\\n**The Chart**\\n\\nFrom a [TA perspective](https://i.imgur.com/uE3nJVz.png) a double bottom pattern may be forming on Alphabet's chart. If today's earnings results turn out to be a positive surprise and the stock price climbs above the $160.77 level, it could signal a reversal of the downward trend that has been affecting the tech giant's shares since the beginning of 2025. \\n\\n**Earnings**\\n\\nFor Q1, it looks like the market is expecting Alphabet to report revenue of $89.1 billion (+11% y/y). From what I've read, operating income is expected to reach $28.58 billion (+12% y/y). This stronger profit growth implies a slight margin improvement to above 32.08% (+0.45 pp). Tbh, it looks like effective cost management will be one of the biggest challenges for Alphabet in this environment. While sustaining strong revenue growth seems less at risk, managing expenses (especially given capital-intensive AI development plans) will be challenging.\\n\\n**Cloud Services**\\n\\nFor those who are aware, Google Cloud is a thing and is driving massive growth for the company. With rivals signaling a slowdown in data center expansion amid rising uncertainty, Alphabet may either follow a cautious strategy (likely dampening growth) or seize the opportunity to gain market share by acting aggressively.\\n\\nThe second approach would be riskier and more costly, potentially causing erosion in the segment’s operating margin. It would, however, be an investment in the better future market position.\\n\\nI'm going to be watching not just the quarterly results but also the forward outlook and management’s tone regarding the Cloud business. It looks like the Forecasted Cloud segment has a revenue of $12.32 billion for Q1 2025. This would be the h[ighest quarterly result in Alphabet's history](https://i.imgur.com/9uWUntD.png). However, operating income is expected to slightly decline versus the prior quarter, but at $1.94 billion it would still be over twice the result from Q1 2024.\\n\\n**Tariffs** \\n\\nOne of the key topics that I'll especially be closely watching tonight is the impact of tariffs and macroeconomic uncertainty on the company’s operations. Among the major Big Tech companies, Alphabet has shown the greatest resilience to potential geopolitical turmoil and has often demonstrated the fastest recovery following periods of uncertainty.\\n\\nAt this point, they do not appear to be in significantly better shape than its peers, with its stock down approximately 17% year-to-date, placing it squarely in the middle of the Magnificent Seven stocks.\\n\\nI think the first step toward rebuilding investor confidence will be outlining the scope and impact of tariffs and overall geopolitical uncertainty on the company’s operations. As such, the types of questions I expect during today’s conference about how strongly tariffs will affect Alphabet’s business. It is worth noting that this isn’t necessarily about the direct impact (which is likely to be limited) but rather the indirect effect of uncertainty on the willingness of Alphabet’s clients to spend on advertising, which constitutes a significant portion of the company’s revenue.\\n\\n**Price Targets**\\n\\nAmid these earnings expectations, analysts have been revising Alphabet's price targets downward. Over the past few weeks, [several top analysts have revised their 12-month price targets for Alphabet](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/goog/forecast?utm_source=theglobeandmail.com&amp;utm_medium=referral). TD Cowen lowered its target from $210 to $195. UBS cut its target from $209 to $173. Even Scotiabank lowered its target from $232 to $200. Despite that, they all still rate GOOG stock as a Buy, showing they believe in its long-term value.\\n\\nGuggenheim lowered its target from $215 to $190, while Jefferies adjusted its target from $235 to $200, both maintaining a Buy rating. Piper Sandler and Citi followed suit, reducing their targets to $185 and $195 respectively, citing uncertainties in the advertising landscape and macroeconomic pressures.\\n\\nI mean. With all things considered, the stock is down 19% in 2025 so far. Combine that with rising legal risks (mentioned later here) and an uncertain economy, and you have a good reason to reframe expectations. Analysts aren’t necessarily predicting more downside; they’re just being more realistic about the upside, especially in the near term.\\n\\nIf we’re to simplify the analysts’ overall message, it’s that Alphabet’s fundamentals are strong, but the road ahead could be bumpy.\\n\\n**In the news**\\n\\nA federal court recently ruled that Google violated antitrust laws by monopolizing specific digital advertising markets. The court plans to determine suitable remedies soon. Some analysts believe the ruling could eventually lead to the divestiture of certain Google ad segments, though the financial impact on Alphabet is expected to be modest.\\n\\nThere’s also the bigger picture. Between global tariffs, economic uncertainty, and shifts in labor and costs across the tech industry, Alphabet has a lot on its plate. Investors will want to hear how the company manages expenses, hiring, and regional exposure.\\n\\n**Mergers and Acquisitions**\\n\\nAlphabet announced a $32 billion all-cash deal to acquire cloud security platform Wiz. This acquisition aims to enhance Google Cloud’s security capabilities and multi-cloud operations. Analysts are projecting long-term benefits from this acquisition, despite potential short-term market pressures on other cloud service providers.\\n\\nSeparately, Google has decided to maintain its current approach to offering third-party cookie choices in its Chrome browser, emphasizing the importance of online privacy and user control. This decision is part of Google's ongoing Privacy Sandbox initiative, which aims to strengthen online privacy while supporting a sustainable ad-driven internet environment.\\n\\n**What now?**\\n\\nAlphabet’s stock may be down, but most analysts still believe it’s a long-term winner. That’s why Buy ratings remain steady, even if price targets are down. Q1 earnings could be the reset moment Alphabet needs to win back momentum. I'm thinking short term puts for earnings but holding long term shares. Could even sell covered calls for earnings for some extra income, if you already have the shares.
