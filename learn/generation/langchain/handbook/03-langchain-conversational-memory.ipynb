    "# Conversational Memory with LCEL\n",
    "\n",
    "Conversational memory is how chatbots can respond to our queries in a chat-like manner. It enables a coherent conversation, and without it, every query would be treated as an entirely independent input without considering past interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The memory allows an _\"agent\"_ to remember previous interactions with the user. By default, agents are *stateless* â€” meaning each incoming query is processed independently of other interactions. The only thing that exists for a stateless agent is the current input, nothing else.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many applications where remembering previous interactions is very important, such as chatbots. Conversational memory allows us to do that.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we'll explore conversational memory using modern LangChain Expression Language (LCEL) and the recommended `RunnableWithMessageHistory` class.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll start by importing all of the libraries that we'll be using in this example."

      "1. **Knowledge Bases and Databases**: You can connect LLMs to structured databases (like SQL databases) or knowledge bases (like Wikidata) to retrieve factual information. This can help the model provide accurate answers to specific queries, especially in fields like medicine, law, or science.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **APIs for Real-Time Data**: Integrating with APIs can allow LLMs to access real-time information. For example, connecting to weather APIs can enable the model to provide current weather updates, or financial APIs can give stock market data.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Search Engines**: By integrating with search engines, LLMs can pull in the latest articles, research papers, or news updates. This can help the model stay current and provide users with the most relevant information.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Contextual Memory**: Implementing a memory system where the model can store and recall user-specific information or previous interactions can enhance personalization. This could involve using external storage solutions to keep track of user preferences or past conversations.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Multi-Modal Integration**: Combining LLMs with other types of models (like image recognition or audio processing) can create a more holistic AI experience. For instance, an LLM could analyze text and images together to provide richer responses.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Domain-Specific Knowledge**: Tailoring the model to specific industries (like healthcare, finance, or education) by integrating specialized knowledge sources can improve its performance in those areas. This could involve using curated datasets or expert systems.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Interactive Learning**: Allowing the model to learn from user interactions in real-time can help it adapt and improve over time. This could involve feedback loops where users can correct the model or provide additional context.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. **Semantic Search**: Enhancing the model's ability to understand and retrieve information based on meaning rather than just keywords can lead to more relevant results. This could involve using embeddings or vector databases.\n",
      "\n",
      "9. **Collaborative Filtering**: Integrating user behavior data to recommend content or responses based on similar users' preferences can enhance user experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "10. **Ethical and Bias Considerations**: Integrating external knowledge also opens up discussions about the sources of that knowledge and potential biases. Ensuring that the information is accurate and fair is crucial.\n",

      "\n",
      "1. **Structured Databases**: \n",
      "   - **SQL Databases**: Traditional relational databases that store data in tables. They can provide structured information that the model can query for specific facts.\n",
      "   - **NoSQL Databases**: These include document stores (like MongoDB) and key-value stores (like Redis), which can be useful for unstructured or semi-structured data.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Knowledge Graphs**: \n",
      "   - These are networks of entities and their relationships, such as Google Knowledge Graph or DBpedia. They provide rich contextual information that can help the model understand relationships between concepts.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **APIs**: \n",
      "   - **Public APIs**: Many organizations provide APIs that offer access to real-time data, such as weather, news, or financial information (e.g., OpenWeatherMap, NewsAPI, Alpha Vantage).\n",
      "   - **Custom APIs**: You can create your own APIs to serve specific data relevant to your application.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Web Scraping**: \n",
      "   - Extracting data from websites can provide a wealth of information. This can include articles, product information, or user-generated content from forums and social media.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Document Repositories**: \n",
      "   - Collections of documents, such as PDFs, Word files, or presentations, can be indexed and searched to provide context. This is particularly useful for domain-specific knowledge.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Wikis and Collaborative Platforms**: \n",
      "   - Platforms like Wikipedia or specialized wikis can serve as rich sources of information. They often contain well-structured articles on a wide range of topics.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **User Interaction Data**: \n",
      "   - Data from user interactions, such as chat logs or feedback, can help the model understand user preferences and context over time.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. **Semantic Web Technologies**: \n",
      "   - Using RDF (Resource Description Framework) and SPARQL (a query language for databases) can help integrate and query data from various sources in a semantically meaningful way.\n",
      "\n",
      "9. **Social Media Feeds**: \n",
      "   - Real-time data from platforms like Twitter or Reddit can provide insights into current trends, public sentiment, and topical discussions.\n",
      "\n",
      "10. **Scientific and Academic Databases**: \n",
      "    - Accessing databases like PubMed, arXiv, or Google Scholar can provide the model with up-to-date research findings and academic knowledge.\n",
      "\n",
      "11. **Content Management Systems (CMS)**: \n",
      "    - Integrating with CMS platforms can allow the model to pull in articles, blog posts, or other content that is regularly updated.\n",
      "\n",
      "12. **Multimedia Sources**: \n",

      "\n",
      "AI: There are several types of data sources that can be used to provide context to a Large Language Model (LLM). Here are some key categories:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Structured Databases**: \n",
      "   - **SQL Databases**: Traditional relational databases that store data in tables. They can provide structured information that the model can query for specific facts.\n",
      "   - **NoSQL Databases**: These include document stores (like MongoDB) and key-value stores (like Redis), which can be useful for unstructured or semi-structured data.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Knowledge Graphs**: \n",
      "   - These are networks of entities and their relationships, such as Google Knowledge Graph or DBpedia. They provide rich contextual information that can help the model understand relationships between concepts.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **APIs**: \n",
      "   - **Public APIs**: Many organizations provide APIs that offer access to real-time data, such as weather, news, or financial information (e.g., OpenWeatherMap, NewsAPI, Alpha Vantage).\n",
      "   - **Custom APIs**: You can create your own APIs to serve specific data relevant to your application.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Web Scraping**: \n",
      "   - Extracting data from websites can provide a wealth of information. This can include articles, product information, or user-generated content from forums and social media.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Document Repositories**: \n",
      "   - Collections of documents, such as PDFs, Word files, or presentations, can be indexed and searched to provide context. This is particularly useful for domain-specific knowledge.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Wikis and Collaborative Platforms**: \n",
      "   - Platforms like Wikipedia or specialized wikis can serve as rich sources of information. They often contain well-structured articles on a wide range of topics.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **User Interaction Data**: \n",
      "   - Data from user interactions, such as chat logs or feedback, can help the model understand user preferences and context over time.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. **Semantic Web Technologies**: \n",
      "   - Using RDF (Resource Description Framework) and SPARQL (a query language for databases) can help integrate and query data from various sources in a semantically meaningful way.\n",
      "\n",
      "9. **Social Media Feeds**: \n",
      "   - Real-time data from platforms like Twitter or Reddit can provide insights into current trends, public sentiment, and topical discussions.\n",
      "\n",
      "10. **Scientific and Academic Databases**: \n",
      "    - Accessing databases like PubMed, arXiv, or Google Scholar can provide the model with up-to-date research findings and academic knowledge.\n",
      "\n",
      "11. **Content Management Systems (CMS)**: \n",
      "    - Integrating with CMS platforms can allow the model to pull in articles, blog posts, or other content that is regularly updated.\n",
      "\n",
      "12. **Multimedia Sources**: \n",
      "    - Incorporating data from images, videos, or audio can provide additional context. For example, using image recognition to analyze visual content alongside text.\n",
      "\n",

      "Response: There are several exciting possibilities when it comes to integrating Large Language Models with external knowledge. Here are a few ideas to consider:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Knowledge Bases and Databases**: You can connect LLMs to structured databases (like SQL databases) or knowledge bases (like Wikidata) to retrieve factual information. This can help the model provide accurate answers to specific queries that require up-to-date or detailed data.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **APIs for Real-Time Data**: Integrating with APIs can allow LLMs to access real-time information, such as weather updates, stock prices, or news articles. This can make the model more dynamic and relevant to current events.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Search Engines**: By integrating with search engines, LLMs can pull in information from the web, allowing them to provide a broader range of answers and insights. This could involve using web scraping techniques or leveraging search API results.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Contextual Knowledge**: You could enhance LLMs with domain-specific knowledge by integrating them with specialized databases or ontologies. For example, in healthcare, linking to medical databases can help the model provide more accurate medical advice or information.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **User Personalization**: By integrating user data (with consent), LLMs can tailor responses based on individual preferences, past interactions, or specific user contexts, making the conversation more engaging and relevant.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Multi-Modal Integration**: Combining LLMs with other AI models, such as image recognition or audio processing, can create a more holistic system. For instance, an LLM could analyze text and images together to provide richer insights.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Feedback Loops**: Implementing a system where user feedback is used to refine the model's responses can help improve accuracy over time. This could involve a mechanism for users to rate responses or provide corrections.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. **Interactive Learning**: Allowing the model to learn from interactions in real-time can help it adapt to new information and changing contexts, making it more robust and versatile.\n",
      "\n",
      "9. **Semantic Search**: Enhancing LLMs with semantic search capabilities can improve their ability to understand user intent and retrieve relevant information more effectively.\n",
      "\n",
      "10. **Ethical and Responsible AI**: Integrating external knowledge can also involve ensuring that the information is accurate, unbiased, and ethically sourced. This could include implementing checks and balances to filter out misinformation.\n",
