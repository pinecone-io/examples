    "# Conversational Memory with LCEL\n",
    "\n",
    "Conversational memory is how chatbots can respond to our queries in a chat-like manner. It enables a coherent conversation, and without it, every query would be treated as an entirely independent input without considering past interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The memory allows an _\"agent\"_ to remember previous interactions with the user. By default, agents are *stateless* â€” meaning each incoming query is processed independently of other interactions. The only thing that exists for a stateless agent is the current input, nothing else.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many applications where remembering previous interactions is very important, such as chatbots. Conversational memory allows us to do that.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we'll explore conversational memory using modern LangChain Expression Language (LCEL) and the recommended `RunnableWithMessageHistory` class.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll start by importing all of the libraries that we'll be using in this example."

      "   - These are networks of entities and their relationships, such as Wikidata or DBpedia. They provide rich contextual information that can help the model understand connections between concepts.\n",

      "3. **APIs**: \n",
      "   - **Public APIs**: Many organizations provide APIs that offer access to real-time data, such as weather, news, or financial information.\n",

      "\n",
      "6. **User-Generated Content**: \n",
      "   - Platforms like forums, social media, or review sites can provide insights into public opinion, trends, and user experiences, which can be valuable for context.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Domain-Specific Databases**: \n",
      "   - Specialized databases in fields like medicine (e.g., PubMed), law (e.g., legal databases), or finance (e.g., stock market databases) can provide expert-level information.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. **Historical Data**: \n",
      "   - Archival data or historical records can provide context for understanding trends over time, which can be particularly useful in fields like economics or social sciences.\n",
      "\n",
      "9. **Multimedia Sources**: \n",

      "\n",
      "1. **Structured Databases**: \n",
      "   - **SQL Databases**: These can store structured data in tables, making it easy to query specific information.\n",
      "   - **NoSQL Databases**: These can handle unstructured or semi-structured data, such as documents or key-value pairs, which can be useful for more flexible data retrieval.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Knowledge Graphs**: \n",
      "   - These are networks of entities and their relationships, such as Wikidata or DBpedia. They provide rich contextual information that can help the model understand connections between concepts.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **APIs**: \n",
      "   - **Public APIs**: Many organizations provide APIs that offer access to real-time data, such as weather, news, or financial information.\n",
      "   - **Custom APIs**: You can create your own APIs to serve specific data relevant to your application or domain.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Web Scraping**: \n",
      "   - Extracting data from websites can provide a wealth of information, especially for niche topics or current events. However, it's important to consider legal and ethical implications.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Document Repositories**: \n",
      "   - Collections of documents, such as research papers, articles, or manuals, can be indexed and searched to provide detailed information on specific topics.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **User-Generated Content**: \n",
      "   - Platforms like forums, social media, or review sites can provide insights into public opinion, trends, and user experiences, which can be valuable for context.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Domain-Specific Databases**: \n",
      "   - Specialized databases in fields like medicine (e.g., PubMed), law (e.g., legal databases), or finance (e.g., stock market databases) can provide expert-level information.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. **Historical Data**: \n",
      "   - Archival data or historical records can provide context for understanding trends over time, which can be particularly useful in fields like economics or social sciences.\n",
      "\n",
      "9. **Multimedia Sources**: \n",
      "   - Images, videos, and audio files can be analyzed and used to provide context. For example, integrating image recognition can help the model understand visual content.\n",
      "\n",
      "10. **Feedback and Interaction Logs**: \n",
      "    - Data from user interactions with the model can be used to refine its understanding and improve its responses over time.\n",
      "\n",

      "Response: There are several exciting possibilities when it comes to integrating Large Language Models with external knowledge. Here are a few ideas to consider:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Knowledge Bases**: Integrating LLMs with structured knowledge bases like Wikidata or specialized databases (e.g., medical databases, legal databases) can help the model provide more accurate and up-to-date information. This could be particularly useful in fields where precision is critical.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Real-Time Data Access**: By connecting LLMs to APIs that provide real-time data (like weather, stock prices, or news), you can create applications that offer timely and relevant information. For example, a travel assistant could provide current flight statuses or weather conditions.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Personalization**: Using external data sources to personalize responses based on user preferences or past interactions can enhance user experience. For instance, integrating with a userâ€™s calendar or preferences could allow the model to suggest tailored activities or reminders.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Contextual Understanding**: By feeding the model with context from external sources, such as user profiles or historical interactions, it can generate responses that are more relevant and context-aware. This could be particularly useful in customer service applications.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Multi-Modal Integration**: Combining LLMs with other types of data, such as images or audio, can create richer interactions. For example, an LLM could analyze an image and provide a description or answer questions about it.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Dynamic Learning**: Implementing mechanisms for the model to learn from new information continuously can keep it updated. This could involve using feedback loops where user interactions help refine the model's responses over time.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Enhanced Reasoning**: Integrating logical reasoning engines or rule-based systems can help LLMs perform better in tasks that require deductive reasoning or complex problem-solving.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. **Domain-Specific Applications**: Tailoring LLMs to specific industries (like healthcare, finance, or education) by integrating domain-specific knowledge can improve their effectiveness in those areas. This could involve using specialized vocabularies or regulatory frameworks.\n",
      "\n",
      "9. **Collaborative Tools**: Creating collaborative platforms where LLMs assist in brainstorming or project management by pulling in relevant external data can enhance productivity and creativity.\n",
      "\n",
      "10. **Ethical and Bias Considerations**: Integrating external knowledge can also help address biases in LLMs by providing diverse perspectives and information sources, leading to more balanced outputs.\n",

      "6. **Document Repositories**: Accessing documents such as PDFs, Word files, or presentations can provide context on specific topics. This could be particularly useful in specialized fields like law or medicine, where documents contain critical information.\n",
