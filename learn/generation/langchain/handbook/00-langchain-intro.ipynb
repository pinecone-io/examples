        "LangChain is a popular framework that allow users to quickly build apps and pipelines around **L**arge **L**anguage **M**odels. It can be used for chatbots, RAG, agents, and much more.\n",
        "\n",
        "The core idea of the library is that we can _\"chain\"_ together different components to create more advanced use-cases around LLMs. These chains (better thought of as pipelines or workflows) may consist of various components from several modules:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Prompt templates**: Prompt templates are, well, templates for different types of prompts. Like \"chatbot\" style templates, ELI5 question-answering, etc\n",
        "\n",
        "* **LLMs**: Large language models like GPT-4.1, Claude 4, etc\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Tool / function calling**: Allow us to augment our LLMs with additional abilities / information sources.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Agents**: Agents act as the framework that integrates LLMs and tools.LLMs are packaged into logical loops of operations with tools like web search, **R**etrieval **A**ugmented **G**eneration (RAG), or code execution.\n",
