Memorization ( Tirumala et al. ,2022) combined with compositionality ( Zhou et al. ,2022)\\ncapabilities made LLMs able to execute various tasks such as language understanding or conditional and unconditional text generation at an unprecedented level of pe rformance, thus opening a realistic path towards\\nhigher-bandwidth human-computer interactions.\\nHowever, LLMs suﬀer from important limitations hindering a broader deployment. LLMs often provide nonfactual but seemingly plausible predictions, often referr ed to as hallucinations ( Welleck et al. ,2020). This\\nleads to many avoidable mistakes, for example in the context of arithmetics ( Qian et al. ,2022) or within\\na reasoning chain ( Wei et al. ,2022c ). Moreover, many LLMs groundbreaking capabilities seem to emerge', metadata={'chunk-id': '5', 'id': '2302.07842', 'source': 'http://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.07842', 'title': 'Augmented Language Models: a Survey'}),\n",
