    "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a powerful technique in natural language processing that combines the strengths of large language models with external knowledge retrieval. RAG systems enhance the capabilities of AI models by allowing them to access and utilize relevant information from a curated knowledge base, leading to more accurate, up-to-date, and context-aware responses. Building a reliable, curated, and accurate RAG system is crucial for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Improved Accuracy:** By retrieving relevant information, RAG systems can provide more precise and factual responses.\n",
    "- **Reduced Hallucinations:** Access to external knowledge helps minimize the risk of AI models generating false or inconsistent information.\n",
    "- **Adaptability:** RAG systems can be easily updated with new information without retraining the entire model.\n",
    "- **Trustworthiness:** The ability to trace responses back to source documents enhances explainability and trust in AI-generated content.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll explore how to build such a system using [Cleanlab](https://cleanlab.ai/) and Pinecone.\n",
    "Cleanlab is a company that specializes in data-centric AI, focusing on improving the quality and reliability of AI/ML systems. Cleanlab's Trustworthy Language Model (TLM) is designed to add trust and reliability to AI model outputs and indicate when it's unsure of an answer, making it ideal for applications where unchecked hallucinations could be problematic. This is especially the case for anyone trying to build generative AI applications in production. \n",
    "\n",
    "Pinecone, as a vector database solution, excels in storing and retrieving high-dimensional vectors, making it perfect for managing and querying large-scale document embeddings.\n",
    "\n",
    "By combining Cleanlab's TLM with Pinecone's vector database capabilities, we can create a RAG system that not only retrieves relevant information efficiently but also ensures the quality and reliability of the data being used. This notebook will guide you through the process of:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Using Cleanlab's TLM to tag and clean document data, removing low-quality chunks and personally identifiable information (PII).\n",
    "2. Leveraging Pinecone to create and manage a vector database for storing and retrieving document embeddings.\n",
    "3. Implementing a RAG pipeline that uses both tools to provide accurate and trustworthy responses.\n",
    "4. Utilizing Cleanlab's TLM to classify metadata, enhance retrieval, and evaluate the trustworthiness of RAG outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, you'll have a robust understanding of how to build a RAG system that prioritizes reliability, curation, and accuracy, setting a strong foundation for developing trustworthy AI applications.\n",
