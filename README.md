# What is this repo?

This repository is a collection of sample applications and Jupyter Notebooks that you can run, download, study and modify in order to get hands-on with 
Pinecone [vector databases](https://www.pinecone.io/learn/vector-database/) and common AI patterns, tools and algorithms.

# Two kinds of examples 

This repo contains: 

1. Production ready examples in [`./docs`](./docs) that receive regular review and support from the Pinecone engineering team
2. Examples optimized for learning and exploration of AI techniques in [`./learn`](./learn) and patterns for building different kinds of applications, created and maintained by the Pinecone Developer Advocacy team. 

We appreciate your feedback and contributions. Please see our [contribution guide](./learn/README.md#collaboration) for information on how to contribute to this repo.
