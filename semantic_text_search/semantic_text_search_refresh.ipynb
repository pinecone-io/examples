    "### What is Semantic Search and how will we use it?\n",
    "\n",
    "_Semantic search_ is exactly the kind of search where the _meaning_ of the search query is the thing that's used, rather than it being done by keyword lookups. Pretrained neural networks on large sets of text data have been shown to be very effective at encoding the _meaning_ of a particular phrase, sentence, paragraph or long document into a data structure known as a [vector embedding](https://www.pinecone.io/learn/vector-embeddings/).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we are going to demonstrate Pinecone's semantic search capabilities with an off-the-shelf, pretrained NLP model. In the process we'll learn a few things."

All of the current and former officials spoke on the condition of anonymity because the continuing investigation is classified, the newspaper reported.\\nThe officials said one of the advisers picked up on the calls was Paul Manafort, who was Trump's campaign chairman for several months last year and had worked as a political consultant in Russia ...\n",
