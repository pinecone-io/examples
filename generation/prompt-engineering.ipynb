    "\n",
    "A prompt can consist of multiple components:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Instructions\n",
    "* External information or context\n",
    "* User input or query\n",
    "* Output indicator\n",
    "\n",
    "Not all prompts require all of these components, but often a good prompt will use two or more of them. Let's define what they all are more precisely.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Instructions** tell the model what to do, typically how it should use inputs and/or external information to produce the output we want.\n",
    "\n",
    "**External information or context** are additional information that we either manually insert into the prompt, retrieve via a vector database (long-term memory), or pull in through other means (API calls, calculations, etc).\n",
    "\n",
    "**User input or query** is typically a query directly input by the user of the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output indicator** is the *beginning* of the generated text. For a model generating Python code we may put `import ` (as most Python scripts begin with a library `import`), or a chatbot may begin with `Chatbot: ` (assuming we format the chatbot script as lines of interchanging text between `User` and `Chatbot`).\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these components should usually be placed the order we've described them. We start with instructions, provide context (if needed), then add the user input, and finally end with the output indicator."

    "\n",
    "The `temperature` parameter used in generation models tells us how \"random\" the model can be. It represents the probability of a model to choose a word which is *not* the first choice of the model.\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "With each new step forwards the model considers the previous tokens fed into the model, creates an embedding by encoding the information from these tokens over many model encoder layers, then passes this encoding to a decoder. The decoder then predicts the probability of each token that the model knows (ie is within the model *vocabulary*) based on the information encoded within the embedding.\n",
    "\n",
    "TK visualize the encoding at one timestep -> decoding -> prediction over many tokens\n",
    "\n",
    "At a temperature of `0.0` the decoder will always select the top predicted token. At a temperature of `1.0` the model will always select a word that *is predicted* considering it's assigned probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "TK visualize selection of always top word over several timesteps when temp == 0, compared to selection of over words over several timesteps when temp == 1\n",
    "\n",
    "Considering all of this, if we have a conservative, fact based Q&A like in the previous example, it makes sense to set a lower `temperature`. However, if we're wanting to produce some creative writing or chatbot conversations, we might want to experiment and increase `temperature`. Let's try it."
