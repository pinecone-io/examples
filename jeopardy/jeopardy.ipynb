In fact, particular MSMARCO model used in this example generates [unit vectors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_vector), which make [vector comparisons](https://towardsdatascience.com/importance-of-distance-metrics-in-machine-learning-modelling-e51395ffe60d) agnostic to one's choice of similarity scores. In other words, when defining the index, it does not matter whether we use `euclidean`, `cosine` or `dotproduct` as a metric, so we left it blank, using the `cosine` default. "
